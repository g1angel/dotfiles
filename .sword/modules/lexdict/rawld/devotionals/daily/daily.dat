<center>                <b>Daily Light on the Daily Path:</b><br />
       A Devotional Textbook for Every Day of the Year,<br />
                In the Very Words of Scripture.<br />
            Prepared by Jonathan Bagster [1813-1872]<br />
                and Other Members of His Family.<br />
<br />
   First published in New York by the American Tract Society,<br />
                         ca. 1875.<br />
</center><br />
 DAILY LIGHT ON THE DAILY PATH consists of thematic Scripture<br />
 readings for the morning and evening hours, for each day of the<br />
 year.<br />
<br />
 Bagster's conventions for separating verses have followed<br />
 generally, with some modifications for the sake of consistency.<br />
 The dash (--) separates verses drawn from different books of<br />
 the Bible and non-continguous verses within a chapter; the<br />
 ellipsis (. . .) indicates omissions within a verse or an<br />
 entire verse. While Bagster does not always use ellipses to<br />
 indicate omissions, I have. A handful of reference errors found<br />
 in the printed version have been corrected in this electronic<br />
 edition.<br />
<br />
 Addenda and corrigenda are earnestly solicited.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      [This] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which<br />
        are behind, . . . I press toward the mark for the<br />
        prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Father, I will that they . . . whom thou hast given to me, be<br />
 with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou<br />
 hast given to me.-- I know whom I have believed, and am<br />
 persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to<br />
 him until that day.-- He who hath begun a good work in you will<br />
 perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Know ye not that they who run in a race all run, but one<br />
 receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man<br />
 that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now<br />
 they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an<br />
 incorruptible. Wherefore seeing we also are surrounded with so<br />
 great a cloud of witnesses.--Let us lay aside every weight, and<br />
 the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with<br />
 patience the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus.<br />

<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
          The LORD, he [it is] that doth go before thee;<br />
           he will be with thee, he will not fail thee.<br />
<br />
    If thy presence shall not attend [me], conduct us not from<br />
 here.--O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself:<br />
 [it is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.<br />
<br />
    The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he<br />
 delighteth in his way. Though he should fall, he shall not be<br />
 utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.<br />
<br />
    I [am] continually with thee: thou hast held [me] by my right<br />
 hand. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward<br />
 receive me [to] glory.--I am persuaded, that neither death, nor<br />
 life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things<br />
 present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any<br />
 other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of<br />
 God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                  Sing to the LORD a new song.<br />
<br />
 Sing aloud to God our strength: make a joyful noise to the God<br />
 of Jacob. Take a psalm, and strike the timbrel, the pleasant<br />
 harp with the psaltery.--He hath put a new song in my mouth,<br />
 [even] praise to our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and<br />
 shall trust in the LORD.<br />
<br />
    Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be<br />
 thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee wherever thou<br />
 goest.--The joy of the LORD is your strength.--Paul . . .<br />
 thanked God, and took courage.<br />
<br />
    Knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of<br />
 sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.<br />
 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore<br />
 cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of<br />
 light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in revellings<br />
 and drunkenness, not in immorality and wantonness, not in strife<br />
 and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not<br />
 provision for the lusts of flesh.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
     Let my prayer be set forth before thee [as] incense;<br />
 [and] the lifting up of my hands [as] the evening sacrifice.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: . . . and thou<br />
 shalt put it before the veil that [is] by the ark of the<br />
 testimony, before the mercy seat that [is] over the testimony,<br />
 where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn upon it sweet<br />
 incense every morning: . . . and when Aaron lighteth the lamps<br />
 at the evening, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual<br />
 incense before the LORD throughout your generations.<br />
<br />
    [Jesus] is able also to save them to the uttermost that come<br />
 to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for<br />
 them.--The smoke of the incense, [which came] with the prayers<br />
 of the saints, ascended before God out of the angel's hand.<br />
<br />
    Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an<br />
 holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to<br />
 God by Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Pray without ceasing.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               He led them forth by the right way.<br />
<br />
    He found [Jacob] in a desert land, and in the waste howling<br />
 wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as<br />
 the apple of his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest,<br />
 fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh<br />
 them, beareth them on her wings: [So] the LORD alone did lead<br />
 him.--[Even] to [your] old age I [am] he; and [even] to gray<br />
 hairs will I carry [you]: I have made, and I will bear; even I<br />
 will carry, and will deliver [you].<br />
<br />
    He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of<br />
 righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through<br />
 the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou<br />
 [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.<br />
<br />
    The LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul<br />
 in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a<br />
 watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail<br />
 not.--For this God [is] our God for ever and ever: he will be<br />
 our guide [even] to death.--Who teacheth like him?<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
             What wilt thou that I shall do to thee?<br />
             . . . Lord, that I may receive my sight.<br />
<br />
    Open thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of<br />
 thy law.<br />
<br />
    Then he opened their understanding, that they might<br />
 understand the scriptures.--The Comforter, [who is] the Holy<br />
 Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, . . . shall teach<br />
 you all things.--Every good gift and every perfect gift is from<br />
 above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.<br />
<br />
    The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, . . .<br />
 give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge<br />
 of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that<br />
 ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches<br />
 of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what [is] the<br />
 exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe,<br />
 according to the working of his mighty power.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           Ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the<br />
         inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.<br />
<br />
    This [is] not [your] rest.--There remaineth therefore a rest<br />
 to the people of God.--Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the<br />
 soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that<br />
 Within the veil; where the forerunner hath for us entered,<br />
 [even] Jesus.<br />
<br />
    In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were] not<br />
 [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br />
 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and<br />
 receive you to myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also.<br />
 --With Christ; which is far better.<br />
<br />
    God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there<br />
 shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither<br />
 shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed<br />
 away.--There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the<br />
 weary are at rest.<br />
<br />
    Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. For where your<br />
 treasure is, there will your heart be also.--Set your affection<br />
 on things above, not on things on the earth.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                 O death, where [is] thy sting?<br />
                O grave, where [is] thy victory?<br />
<br />
    The sting of death [is] sin.--But now once in the end of the<br />
 world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of<br />
 himself. And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after<br />
 this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the sins<br />
 of many; and to them that look for him he shall appear the<br />
 second time without sin to salvation.<br />
<br />
    Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he<br />
 also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death<br />
 he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the<br />
 devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their<br />
 lifetime subject to bondage.<br />
<br />
    I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is<br />
 at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my]<br />
 course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for<br />
 me a crown of righteousness.<br />
<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            We who have believed do enter into rest.<br />
<br />
    They . . . weary themselves to commit iniquity.--I see<br />
 another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,<br />
 and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my<br />
 members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the<br />
 body of this death?<br />
<br />
    Come to me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I<br />
 will give you rest.--Being justified by faith, we have peace<br />
 with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have<br />
 access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice<br />
 in hope of the glory of God.<br />
<br />
    He that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from<br />
 his own works.--Not having my own righteousness, which is from<br />
 the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the<br />
 righteousness which is from God by faith.--This [is] the rest<br />
 [with which] ye may cause the weary to rest; and this [is] the<br />
 refreshing.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth;<br />
                    keep the door of my lips.<br />
<br />
    If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall<br />
 stand?--They provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly<br />
 with his lips.<br />
<br />
    Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that<br />
 which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.<br />
<br />
    A whisperer separateth chief friends.--There is that speaketh<br />
 like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise [is]<br />
 health. The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a<br />
 lying tongue [is] but for a moment.--The tongue can no man tame;<br />
 [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. . . . Out of the<br />
 same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these<br />
 things ought not so to be.<br />
<br />
    Put off . . . anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy<br />
 communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing<br />
 ye have put off the old man with his deeds.--This is the will of<br />
 God, [even] your sanctification.--In their mouth was found no<br />
 guile.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
         Let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us:<br />
           and establish thou the work of our hands.<br />
<br />
    Thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for<br />
 it [was] perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon<br />
 thee, saith the Lord GOD.--We all, with unveiled face beholding<br />
 as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same<br />
 image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the<br />
 Lord.--The spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [is] every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in<br />
 his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands: happy<br />
 [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well with thee.--Commit thy<br />
 works to the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.<br />
<br />
    Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it<br />
 is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good<br />
 pleasure.--Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our<br />
 Father, who hath loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting<br />
 consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts,<br />
 and establish you in every good word and work.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
  The apostles assembled themselves to Jesus, and told him all<br />
   things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.<br />
<br />
    There is a friend [that] sticketh closer than a brother.--The<br />
 LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his<br />
 friend.--Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.<br />
 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not<br />
 what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all<br />
 things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to<br />
 you.<br />
<br />
    When ye shall have done all the things which are commanded<br />
 you, say, We are unprofitable servants.<br />
<br />
    Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but<br />
 ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba,<br />
 Father.<br />
<br />
    By prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your<br />
 requests be made known to God.--The prayer of the upright [is]<br />
 his delight.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                Think upon me, my God, for good.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy<br />
 youth, the love of thy espousals, when thou wentest after me in<br />
 the wilderness.--I will remember my covenant with thee in the<br />
 days of thy youth, and I will establish to thee an everlasting<br />
 covenant.--I will visit you, and perform my good word toward<br />
 you.--For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the<br />
 LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an<br />
 expected end.<br />
<br />
    [As] the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways<br />
 higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.--I<br />
 would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause: who doeth<br />
 great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without<br />
 number.--Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which]<br />
 thou hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] toward us: they<br />
 cannot be reckoned up in order to thee: [if] I would declare and<br />
 speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
             I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.<br />
<br />
    There failed nothing of any good thing which the LORD had<br />
 spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.--God [is] not a<br />
 man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should<br />
 repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he<br />
 spoke, and shall he not make it good?<br />
<br />
    The LORD thy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, who keepeth<br />
 covenant and mercy with them that love him.--He will ever be<br />
 mindful of his covenant.<br />
<br />
    Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not<br />
 have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,<br />
 yet I will not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the<br />
 palms of [my] hands; thy walls [are] continually before me.<br />
<br />
    The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will<br />
 save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his<br />
 love, he will joy over thee with singing.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
       They that know thy name will put their trust in thee:<br />
       for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.<br />
<br />
    The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous<br />
 runneth into it, and is safe.--I will trust, and not be afraid:<br />
 for the LORD [is] my strength and [my] song; he also is become<br />
 my salvation.<br />
<br />
    I have been young, and [now] am old; yet I have not seen the<br />
 righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.--For the LORD<br />
 loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are<br />
 preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br />
 --The LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's<br />
 sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.--<br />
 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in<br />
 whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us].<br />
<br />

    The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and [there shall<br />

 for I will pardon them whom I reserve.--Who [is] a God like<br />
 thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression<br />
 of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for<br />
 ever, because he delighteth [in] mercy. He will turn again, he<br />
 will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and<br />
 thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br />
<br />
   He hath made us accepted in the beloved.--To present you holy<br />
 and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:<br />
<br />
    Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to<br />
 present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with<br />
 exceeding joy, to God the only wise, our Saviour, [be] glory and<br />
 majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br />

 for they are white already to harvest.--Yet a little while, and<br />

<br />
    As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so my soul<br />
 panteth after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the<br />

 will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all<br />
 the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to<br />
 enquire in his temple.<br />

    To us [there is but] one God, the Father, from whom [are] all<br />

 honoureth not the Father who hath sent him.--By him therefore<br />
 let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that<br />
 is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.--Whoever<br />
 offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth [his]<br />

            Who redeemeth thy life from destruction.<br />

    Their Redeemer [is] strong; the LORD of hosts [is] his name.<br />
 --I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem<br />
 them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will<br />
 be thy destruction.<br />
<br />
    Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he<br />
 also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death<br />
 he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the<br />
 devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their<br />
 lifetime subject to bondage.<br />
<br />
    He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he<br />
 that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of<br />
 God abideth on him.<br />
<br />
    For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br />
 When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also<br />
 appear with him in glory.--When he shall come to be glorified in<br />
 his saints, and to be admired by all them that believe (because<br />
 our testimony among you was believed) in that day.<br />

                God the only wise, our Saviour.<br />
<br />
    Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and<br />
 righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.--Canst thou<br />
 by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to<br />
 perfection? [It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do?<br />
 deeper than hell; what canst thou know?<br />
<br />
    We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden<br />
 [wisdom], which God ordained before the world to our glory.--The<br />
 mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in<br />
 God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that<br />
 now to the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might<br />
 be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,<br />
<br />
    If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth<br />
 to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be<br />
 given to him.--The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then<br />
 peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be entreated, full of mercy and<br />
 good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.<br />

 not tarry.--[He shall be] as the light of the morning, [when]<br />
 the sun riseth, [even] a morning without clouds.<br />
<br />
    I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a<br />
 place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself;<br />
 that where I am, [there] ye may be also.--Let not your heart be<br />
 troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard that I said to<br />
 you, I go away, and come [again] to you.<br />
<br />
    Let all thy enemies perish, O LORD: but [let] them that love<br />
 him [be] as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.--Ye are<br />

 shall never allow the righteous to be moved.--I will trust, and<br />
 not be afraid: for the LORD [is] my strength and [my] song; he<br />
 also is become my salvation.<br />
<br />
    Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?--Be anxious for<br />
 nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with<br />
 thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the<br />
 peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your<br />
 hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.--In quietness and in<br />

 that I speak to you I speak not from myself: but the Father that<br />
 dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.<br />
<br />
    The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his<br />
 hand.--Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should<br />
 give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<br />
<br />
    Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith to<br />
 him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not<br />
 known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and<br />
 how sayest thou [then], Show us the Father? Believest thou not<br />

 Father are one.--As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved<br />
 you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye<br />
 shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's<br />
 commandments, and abide in his love.<br />

 [things] under the earth; and [that] every tongue should confess<br />
 that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the<br />
 Father.--Far above all principality, and power, and might, and<br />
 dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world,<br />
 but also in that which is to come.--By him were all things<br />
 created, that are in heaven, and that are upon earth, visible<br />
 and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities,<br />
 or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.<br />
<br />
    Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be<br />
 Lord both of the dead and the living.--And ye are complete in<br />
 him, who is the head of all principality and power.--Of his<br />
 fulness have we all received, and grace for grace.<br />

<br />
    Holy men of God spoke [as they were] moved by the Holy<br />
 Spirit.--That which we have seen and heard we declare to you,<br />
 that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our<br />
 fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,<br />
 and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me<br />
 have. And when he had thus spoken, he showed them [his] hands<br />
 and [his] feet.--He that saw [it] testified, and his testimony<br />
 is true: and he knoweth that he speaketh truth, that ye may<br />
 believe.<br />
<br />
    We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made<br />
 known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but<br />
 were eyewitnesses of his majesty.--That your faith should not<br />
 stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                  Thou hast in love to my soul<br />
           [delivered it] from the pit of corruption.<br />
<br />
    God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might<br />
 live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but<br />
 that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for<br />
 our sins.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] a God like thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and<br />
 passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he<br />
 retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth [in]<br />
 mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he<br />
 will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins<br />
 into the depths of the sea.--O LORD my God, I cried to thee, and<br />
 thou hast healed me. O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from<br />
 the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to<br />
 the pit.--When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD:<br />
 and my prayer came to thee, into thy holy temple.--I waited<br />
 patiently for the LORD; and he inclined to me, and heard my cry.<br />
 He brought me up . . . out of an horrible pit, out of the miry<br />
 clay, and set my feet upon a rock.<br />

                      The things which are.<br />

    Now we see in a mirror, darkly.--Now we see not yet all<br />
 things subjected to him.<br />
<br />
    We have . . . a more sure word of prophecy; to which ye do<br />
 well that ye take heed, as to a light that shineth in a dark<br />
 place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your<br />
 hearts.--Thy word [is] a lamp to my feet, and a light to my<br />
 path.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before by<br />
 the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; that they told you there<br />
 would be mockers in the last time, who would walk after their<br />
 own ungodly lusts.--The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the<br />
 latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to<br />
 seducing spirits, and doctrines of demons.<br />
<br />
    Little children, it is the last time.--The night is far<br />
 spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works<br />
 of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                      Him that was to come.<br />
<br />
    Jesus . . . made a little lower than the angels for the<br />
 suffering of death, . . . that he by the grace of God should<br />
 taste death for every man.--One died for all.--As by one man's<br />
 disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one<br />
 shall many be made righteous.<br />
<br />
    The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was<br />
 made] a living spirit.--That [was] not first which is spiritual,<br />
 but that which is natural; and afterward that which is<br />
 spiritual.--God said, Let us make man in our image, after our<br />
 likeness. . . . So God created man in his [own] image, in the<br />
 image of God created he him.--God hath in these last days spoken<br />
 to us by [his] Son, the brightness of [his] glory, and the<br />
 express image of his person.--Thou hast given him power over all<br />
 flesh.<br />
<br />
    The first man [is] from the earth, earthy: the second man<br />
 [is] the Lord from heaven. As [is] the earthy, such [are] they<br />
 also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they<br />
 also that are heavenly.<br />

<br />
              The things which shall be after this.<br />
<br />
    It is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have<br />
 entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath<br />
 prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed [them] to<br />
 us by his Spirit.--The Spirit of truth . . . will show you<br />
 things to come.<br />
<br />
    Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,<br />
 and they [also] who pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth<br />
 shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.<br />
<br />
    I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning<br />
 them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have<br />
 no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even<br />
 so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. . . .<br />
 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,<br />
 with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God:<br />
 and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we who are alive<br />
 [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the<br />
 clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be<br />
 with the Lord.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           Serving the Lord with all humility of mind.<br />
<br />
    Whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;<br />
 and whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:<br />
 even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to<br />
 minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br />
<br />
    If a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is<br />
 nothing, he deceiveth himself.--I say, to every man that is<br />
 among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought<br />
 to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to<br />
 every man the measure of faith.--When ye shall have done all the<br />
 things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable<br />
 servants: we have done that which it was our duty to do.<br />
<br />
    Our rejoicing is this, . . . that in simplicity and godly<br />
 sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we<br />
 have behaved ourselves in the world We have this treasure in<br />
 earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God,<br />
 and not from us.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            We have turned every one to his own way.<br />
<br />
     Noah . . . planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and<br />
 was drunk.--[Abram] said to Sarai his wife, . . . Say, I pray<br />
 thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy<br />
 sake.--Isaac said to Jacob, . . . [Art] thou my very son Esau?<br />
 And he said, I [am].--Moses . . . spoke unadvisedly with his<br />
 lips.--The men took of their provisions, and asked not [counsel]<br />
 at the mouth of the LORD. And Joshua made peace with them.--<br />
 David did [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD, and<br />
 turned not aside from any [thing] that he commanded him all the<br />
 days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah the<br />
 Hittite.<br />
<br />
    These all . . . obtained a good report through faith.-- Being<br />
 justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in<br />
 Jesus Christ.--The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br />
<br />
    Not for your sakes do I [this], saith the Lord GOD, be it<br />
 known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways.<br />

    The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld<br />
 his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)<br />
 full of grace and truth.--Thou hast magnified thy word above all<br />
 thy name.<br />
<br />
    They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted<br />
 is, God with us.--JESUS: for he shall save his people from their<br />
 sins.--That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour<br />
 the Father. God . . . hath highly exalted him, and given him a<br />
 name which is above every name.--Far above all principality, and<br />
 power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named,<br />
 not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and<br />
 put all [things] under his feet.-- He had a name written, that<br />
 no man knew, but he himself . . . KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF<br />
 LORDS.<br />
<br />
    [As for] the Almighty, we cannot find him out.--What [is] his<br />
 name, and what [is] his son's name, if thou canst tell?<br />

<br />
    Ye are not your own. . . . Ye are bought with a price:<br />
 therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which<br />
 are God's.--The LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the<br />
 iron furnace, [even] from Egypt, to be to him a people of<br />
 inheritance, as [ye are] this day.<br />
<br />
    Ye are God's field, [ye are] God's building.--Christ as a son<br />
 over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the<br />
 confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.--A<br />
 spiritual house, an holy priesthood.<br />
<br />
    They shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when<br />
 I make up my jewels.--All mine are thine, and thine are mine;<br />
 and I am glorified in them.--The glory of his inheritance in the<br />
 saints.<br />

    He [is] like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and he<br />
 shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall<br />
 purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that<br />
 they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.<br />
<br />
    We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation<br />
 worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience,<br />
 hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is<br />
 shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to<br />
 us.--If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;<br />
 for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye are<br />
 without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye<br />
 bastards, and not sons. Now no chastening for the present<br />
 seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it<br />
 yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who are<br />
 exercised by it. Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down,<br />
 and the feeble knees.<br />

 the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the<br />

 kingdom of God.<br />
<br />
    Whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.--To you<br />
 therefore who believe [he is] precious: but to them who are<br />
 disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is<br />
 made the head of the corner, And a stone of stumbling, and a<br />
 rock of offence.<br />
<br />
    May it never be that I should glory, except in the cross of<br />
 our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and<br />
 I to the world.--I am crucified with Christ.--They that are<br />
 Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br />
<br />
    If we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]: if we deny<br />
 [him], he also will deny us.<br />

<br />
                       The Lord [is] at hand.<br />
<br />
    The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with<br />
 the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the<br />
 dead in Christ shall rise first: then we who are alive [and]<br />
 remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to<br />
 meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br />
 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.--He who<br />
 testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.<br />
 Even so, come, Lord Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be<br />
 diligent that ye may be found by him in peace, without spot, and<br />
 blameless.--Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very<br />
 God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole<br />
 spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless to the<br />
 coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful [is] he that calleth<br />
 you, who also will do [it].<br />
<br />
    Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of<br />
 the Lord draweth near.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                        The choice vine.<br />
<br />
    My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and<br />
 he dug it, and removed its stones, and planted it with the<br />
 choicest vine, . . . and he expected that it should bring forth<br />
 grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.--Yet I had planted<br />
 thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned<br />
 into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me?<br />
<br />
    Now the works of the flesh are revealed, which are [these];<br />
 Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, envyings,<br />
 murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: . . . but the<br />
 fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,<br />
 gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, self-control.<br />
<br />
    I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every<br />
 branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every<br />
 [branch] that beareth fruit, he trimmeth it, that it may bring<br />
 forth more fruit. Abide in me, and I in you. . . . In this is my<br />
 Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my<br />
 disciples.<br />

<br />
         The righteousness of God [which is] by faith of<br />
       Jesus Christ to all and upon all them that believe.<br />
<br />
    He hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we<br />
 might be made the righteousness of God in him.--Christ hath<br />
 redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for<br />
 us.--Who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and<br />
 sanctification, and redemption.--Not by works of righteousness<br />
 which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by<br />
 the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit;<br />
 which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br />
<br />
    I count all things [to be] loss for the excellence of the<br />
 knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the<br />
 loss of all things, and do count them [to be] dung, that I may<br />
 win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own<br />
 righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through<br />
 the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by<br />
 faith.<br />

<br />
      The Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.<br />

    Jesus . . . lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,<br />
 Father.--Holy Father. . . . O righteous Father.--He said, Abba,<br />
 Father.--Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of<br />
 his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.--For through him<br />
 we both have an access by one Spirit to the Father. Now<br />
 therefore ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but<br />
 fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<br />
<br />
    Doubtless thou [art] our father, . . . thou, O LORD, [art]<br />
 our father, our redeemer; thy name [is] from everlasting.<br />
<br />
    I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him,<br />
 Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no<br />
 more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired<br />
 servants. And he arose, and came to his father.<br />
<br />
    Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.<br />

<br />
        Let us go forth therefore to him outside the camp,<br />
            bearing his reproach. For here we have no<br />
            continuing city, but we seek one to come.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial<br />
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to<br />
 you: but rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ's<br />
 sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be<br />
 glad also with exceeding joy.--As ye are partakers of the<br />
 sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.<br />
<br />
    If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye];<br />
 for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their<br />
 part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<br />
<br />
    They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing<br />
 that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.--<br />
 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,<br />
 than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the<br />
 reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt:<br />
 for he had respect to the recompence of the reward.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
     The Lord Jesus Christ . . . shall change our lowly body,<br />
        that it may be fashioned like his glorious body.<br />
<br />
    Upon the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the<br />
 appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of<br />
 amber, as the appearance of fire around within it, from the<br />
 appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of<br />
 his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of<br />
 fire, and it had brightness on all sides. As the appearance of<br />
 the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the<br />
 appearance of the brightness around. This [was] the appearance<br />
 of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.<br />
<br />
    We all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the<br />
 glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to<br />
 glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.--It doth not yet<br />
 appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,<br />
 we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br />
<br />
    They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more.--They<br />
 sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the<br />
 Lamb.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Ye know that he was revealed to take away<br />
                 our sins; and in him is no sin.<br />
<br />
 God, . . . hath in these last days spoken to us by [his] Son,<br />
 whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made<br />
 the worlds; who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the<br />
 express image of his person, and upholding all things by the<br />
 word of his power, when he had by himself made purification of<br />
 our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.--<br />
 He hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we<br />
 might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br />
<br />
    Pass the time of your sojourning [here] in fear: forasmuch as<br />
 ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, [as]<br />
 silver and gold, from your vain manner of life [received] by<br />
 tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of<br />
 Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who<br />
 verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but<br />
 was revealed in these last times for you.--The love of Christ<br />
 constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for<br />
 all, then were all dead: and [that] he died for all, that<br />
 they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to<br />
 him who died for them, and rose again.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
    I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:<br />
                     therefore choose life.<br />
<br />
    For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith<br />
 the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [ye], and live.<br />
<br />
    If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin:<br />
 but now they have no cloke for their sin.<br />
<br />
    That servant, who knew his lord's will, and prepared not<br />
 [himself], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten<br />
 with many [stripes].<br />
<br />
    The wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal<br />
 life through Jesus Christ our Lord.--He that believeth on the<br />
 Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son<br />
 shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.--Know<br />
 ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants in obedience,<br />
 his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin to death, or of<br />
 obedience to righteousness?<br />
<br />
    If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am,<br />
 there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will<br />
 [my] Father honour.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           As thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be].<br />
<br />
    When they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, be not<br />
 anxious beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye<br />
 premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that<br />
 speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.--Be<br />
 not anxious for to morrow: for to morrow will be anxious for the<br />
 things of itself. Sufficient to the day [is] its own evil.<br />
<br />
    The God of Israel [is] he that giveth strength and power to<br />
 [his] people. Blessed [be] God.--He giveth power to the faint;<br />
 and to [them that have] no might he increaseth strength.<br />
<br />
    My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made<br />
 perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory<br />
 in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10<br />
 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in<br />
 necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:<br />
 for when I am weak, then am I strong.--I can do all things<br />
 through Christ who strengtheneth me.--O my soul, thou hast<br />
 trodden down strength.<br />

    No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but<br />
 grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit<br />
 of righteousness to them who are exercised by it.--The<br />
 fruit of the Spirit.<br />
<br />
    He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.<br />
<br />
    Like as a father pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD<br />
 pitieth them that fear him.<br />
<br />
    Though our outward man is wasted, yet the inward [man] is<br />
 renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for<br />
 a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal<br />
 weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen,<br />
 but at the things which are not seen.<br />

    Though [Jesus] was a Son, yet he learned obedience by the<br />
 things which he suffered.--In all points tempted as [we are,<br />
 yet] without sin.<br />

                       Thou God seest me.<br />

    O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known [me]. Thou knowest<br />
 my down sitting and my up rising, thou understandest my thought<br />
 afar off. Thou comprehend my path and my lying down, and art<br />
 acquainted [with] all my ways. For [there is] not a word on my<br />
 tongue, [but], lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. . . .<br />
 [Such] knowledge [is] too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot<br />
 [attain] to it.<br />
<br />
    The eyes of the LORD [are] in every place, beholding the evil<br />
 and the good.--The ways of man [are] before the eyes of the<br />
 LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.--God knoweth your hearts:<br />
 for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in<br />
 the sight of God.--For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro<br />
 throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf<br />
 of [them] whose heart [is] perfect toward him.<br />
<br />
    Jesus . . . knew all [men], and needed not that any should<br />
 testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.--Lord, thou<br />
 knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.<br />

 morning, and thy faithfulness every night.<br />
<br />

 take up his cross daily, and follow me.--Whoever he is of you<br />

 things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we<br />
 an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I<br />
 fight, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my<br />
 body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest by any means, when I<br />
 have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.--<br />
 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one<br />
 thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and<br />
 reaching forward to those things which are before, I press<br />
 toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in<br />
 Christ Jesus. Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know the<br />
 LORD.<br />

      be] pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and<br />
         shall trouble you in the land in which ye dwell.<br />
<br />
    Fight the good fight of faith.--The weapons of our warfare<br />
 [are] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of<br />
 strong holds; casting down imaginations, . . . and bringing into<br />
 captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.<br />
<br />
    Brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according<br />
 to the flesh. For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall<br />
 die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body,<br />
 ye shall live.<br />
<br />
    The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against<br />
 the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that<br />
 ye cannot do the things that ye would.--I see another law in my<br />

 into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.--We are<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              If a man shall sin against the LORD,<br />
                    who shall plead for him?<br />
<br />
    If any man sinneth, we have an advocate with the Father,<br />
 Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our<br />
 sins: and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the<br />
 whole world.--Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation<br />
 through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the<br />
 remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br />
 to declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he may<br />
 be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.<br />
<br />
    He is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down<br />
 to the pit: I have found a ransom.<br />
<br />
    What shall we then say to these things? If God [is] for us,<br />
 who [can be] against us? . . . Who shall lay any thing to the<br />
 charge of God's elect? [It is] God that justifieth. Who [is] he<br />
 that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, or rather, that is<br />
 risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also<br />
 maketh intercession for us.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                 Whom having not seen, ye love.<br />
<br />
    We walk by faith, not by sight.--We love him, because he<br />
 first loved us.--We have known and believed the love that God<br />
 hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth<br />
 in God, and God in him.--In whom ye also [trusted], after ye<br />
 heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom<br />
 also after ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of<br />
 promise.--God would make known what [is] the riches of the<br />
 glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,<br />
 the hope of glory.<br />
<br />
    If a man saith, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a<br />
 liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how<br />
 can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br />
<br />
    Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou<br />
 hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet]<br />
 have believed.--Blessed [are] all they that put their trust in<br />
 him.<br />

    We are all as an unclean [thing], and all our righteousnesses<br />
 [are] as filthy rags.<br />
<br />
    I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make<br />
 mention of thy righteousness, [even] of thine only.--I will<br />
 greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God;<br />
 for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath<br />
 covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom<br />
 decketh [himself] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth<br />
 [herself] with her jewels.<br />
<br />
    Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him.--To her was<br />
 granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and<br />
 white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.<br />
<br />
    I count all things [to be] loss for the excellence of the<br />
 knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . . . that I may win Christ,<br />
 and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is<br />
 from the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the<br />
 righteousness which is from God by faith.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           Oh that thou wouldest keep [me] from evil.<br />
<br />
    Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.--<br />
 The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.<br />
<br />
    Two [things] have I required of thee; deny [them] not to me<br />
 before I die: remove far from me vanity and lies: give me<br />
 neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:<br />
 lest I be full, and deny [thee], and say, Who [is] the LORD?  or<br />
 lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God [in<br />
 vain].<br />
<br />
    The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve<br />
 thy soul.--I will deliver thee from the hand of the wicked, and<br />
 I will redeem thee from the hand of the terrible.--He that is<br />
 begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth<br />
 him not.<br />
<br />
    Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will<br />
 keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all<br />
 the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.--The Lord<br />
 knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.<br />

<br />
       [One] star differeth from [another] star in glory.<br />

    By the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should<br />
 be] the greatest. And he sat down, and called the twelve, and<br />
 saith to them, If any man desireth to be first, [the same] shall<br />
 be last of all, and servant of all.--Be clothed with humility:<br />
 for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br />
 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that<br />
 he may exalt you in due time.<br />
<br />
    Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who<br />
 . . . made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form<br />
 of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.--Wherefore<br />
 God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is<br />
 above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should<br />
 bow.<br />
<br />
    They that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the<br />

 for ever and ever.<br />

    I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me,<br />

 ye can do nothing.--I can do all things through Christ who<br />
 strengtheneth me.--Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his<br />
 might.--The joy of the LORD is your strength.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye<br />
 that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the<br />
 prophets.--Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble<br />
 knees. Say to them [that are] of a fearful heart, Be strong,<br />
 fear not.--Go in this thy might.<br />
<br />
    If God [is] for us, who [can be] against us?--Therefore<br />
 seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we<br />
 faint not.<br />
<br />
    Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall<br />
 reap, if we faint not.--Thanks [be] to God, who giveth us the<br />
 victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

 in secret places that I shall not see him? . . . Do not I fill<br />
 heaven and earth? saith the LORD.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for<br />
 the pestilence [that] walketh in darkness. . . . Because thou<br />
 hast made the LORD, [who is] my refuge, [even] the Most High,<br />

 any plague come near thy dwelling.--He that keepeth thee will<br />
 not slumber.--The LORD [is] thy keeper: the LORD [is] thy shade<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
          Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.<br />
<br />
    Truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from which<br />
 they came, they might have had opportunity to return. But now<br />
 they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore<br />
 God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared<br />
 for them a city.--Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the<br />
 people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;<br />
 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the<br />
 treasures of Egypt.--The just shall live by faith: but if [any<br />
 man] shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.<br />
 But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them<br />
 that believe to the saving of the soul.--No man, having put his<br />
 hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of<br />
 God.<br />
<br />
    May it never be that I should glory, except in the cross of<br />
 our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and<br />
 I to the world.--Come out from among them, and be ye separate,<br />
 saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will<br />
 receive you.<br />

    He who hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until<br />
 the day of Jesus Christ:<br />

    Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are<br />
 spiritual, restore such one in the spirit of meekness;<br />
 considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<br />
<br />
    He who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall<br />
 save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.--<br />
 Encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward<br />
 all [men].<br />
<br />
    Let us not . . . judge one another any more: but judge this<br />
 rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall<br />
 in [his] brother's way.--We . . . that are strong ought to bear<br />
 the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.<br />
<br />
    Charity . . . rejoiceth not in iniquity. Let him that<br />
 thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.<br />

               I am come that they may have life,<br />
          and that they may have [it] more abundantly.<br />
<br />
    In the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.--She<br />
 took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with<br />
 her; and he ate.<br />
<br />
    The wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal<br />
 life through Jesus Christ our Lord.--If by one man's offence<br />
 death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of<br />
 grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by<br />
 one, Jesus Christ.--Since by man [came] death, by man [came]<br />
 also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even<br />
 so in Christ shall all be made alive.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ,<br />
 who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality<br />
 to light through the gospel.<br />
<br />
    God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his<br />
 Son. He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the<br />
 Son of God hath not life.--For God sent not his Son into the<br />
 world to condemn the world; but that the world through him may<br />
 be saved.<br />

 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy<br />

 and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall<br />
 separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his]<br />
 sheep from the goats.<br />
<br />
    Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of<br />
 their Father.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's<br />
 elect? [It is] God that justifieth. Who [is] he that condemneth?<br />
 [It is] Christ that died, or rather, that is risen again, who is<br />
 even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for<br />
 us.--[There is] therefore now no condemnation to them who are in<br />
 Christ Jesus.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />

          The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant<br />

<br />
    Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he<br />
 was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his<br />
 poverty might be rich.--Where sin abounded, grace did much more<br />
 abound.<br />
<br />
    That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches<br />
 of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.<br />
 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of<br />
 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: Not by works, lest any man<br />
 should boast.--Knowing that a man is not justified by the works<br />
 of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have<br />
 believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith<br />
 of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of<br />
 the law shall no flesh be justified.--According to his mercy he<br />
 saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the<br />
 Holy Spirit; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ<br />
 our Saviour.<br />

 when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud<br />
 voice glorified God, And fell down on [his] face at his feet,<br />
 giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering<br />
 said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?<br />
 There are not found returning to give glory to God, except this<br />

 We have not an high priest who cannot be touched with the<br />
 feeling of our infirmities; but who was in all points tempted as<br />
 [we are, yet] without sin.--Who can have compassion on the<br />
 ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he<br />
 himself also is beset with infirmity.--He cometh, and findeth<br />
 them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou?<br />
 couldest not thou watch one hour?  Watch ye and pray, lest ye<br />
 enter into temptation. The spirit truly [is] ready, but the<br />
 flesh [is] weak.<br />
<br />
    Like as a father pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD<br />
 pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he<br />
 remembereth that we [are] dust.<br />
<br />
    Thou, O Lord, [art] a God full of compassion, and gracious,<br />
 long suffering, and abundant in mercy and truth. O turn to me,<br />
 and have mercy upon me; give thy strength to thy servant, and<br />
 save the son of thy handmaid.<br />

    Blessed [is the man whom] thou choosest, and causest to<br />
 approach [to thee, that] he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be<br />
 satisfied with the goodness of thy house, [even] of thy holy<br />
 temple.--The secret of the LORD [is] with them that fear him;<br />
 and he will show them his covenant.--I have given to them the<br />
 words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and<br />
 have known surely that I came from thee, and they have believed<br />
 that thou didst send me.<br />
<br />
    Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.<br />

    The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the<br />

<br />
    Ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but fellowcitizens<br />
 with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon<br />
 the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ<br />
 himself being the chief corner [stone]; in whom all the building<br />
 fitly framed together groweth to an holy temple in the Lord: in<br />
 whom ye also are built together for an habitation of God through<br />
 the Spirit.--If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is]<br />
 gracious. To whom coming, [as to] a living stone, rejected<br />
 indeed by men, but chosen by God, [and] precious, ye also, as<br />
 living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy<br />
 priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God<br />
 by Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.<br />

                      Now he is comforted.<br />
<br />
    Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon<br />
 withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thy everlasting light,<br />
 and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.--He will swallow up<br />
 death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off<br />
 all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he remove from all<br />
 the earth.--These are they who came out of the great<br />
 tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in<br />
 the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they are before the throne of<br />
 God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that<br />
 sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger<br />
 no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on<br />
 them, nor any heat. For the Lamb who is in the midst of the<br />
 throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains<br />
 of waters.--God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and<br />
 there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,<br />
 neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have<br />
 passed away.<br />

<br />
             The night cometh, when no man can work.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [are] the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth:<br />
 Verily, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;<br />
 and their works follow them.--There the wicked cease [from]<br />
 troubling; and there the weary are at rest.--Samuel said to<br />
 Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?<br />
<br />
    Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for<br />
 [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in<br />
 the grave, where thou goest.--The dead praise not the LORD,<br />
 neither any that go down into silence.<br />
<br />
    For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my<br />
 departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have<br />
 finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is<br />
 laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the<br />
 righteous judge, shall give me at that day.<br />
<br />
    There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he<br />
 that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his<br />
 own works, as God [did] from his.<br />

       The lamp of the body is the eye: therefore when thy<br />

<br />
    The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of<br />
 God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know<br />
 [them], because they are spiritually discerned.--Open thou my<br />
 eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br />
<br />
    I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not<br />
 walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.--We all,<br />
 with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the<br />
 Lord, are changed into the same image . . . [even] as by the<br />
 Spirit of the Lord.--God, who commanded the light to shine out<br />
 of darkness, hath shone into our hearts, to [give] the light of<br />
 the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, . . .<br />

 and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the<br />

<br />
    All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through<br />
 the sea; and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the<br />
 sea; and all ate the same spiritual food; and all drank the same<br />
 spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that<br />
 followed them: and that Rock was Christ.--One of the soldiers<br />
 with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came out blood<br />
 and water.--He [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was]<br />
 bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement for our peace [was]<br />
 upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br />
<br />
    Ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.--My people<br />
 have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of<br />
 living waters, [and] hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken<br />
 cisterns, that can hold no water.<br />
<br />
    If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.--Whoever<br />
 will, let him take the water of life freely.<br />

 They that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the<br />
 LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was<br />
 written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that<br />
 thought upon his name.<br />
<br />
    It came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and<br />
 reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.--Where<br />
 two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst<br />
 of them.--My fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of<br />
 life.<br />
<br />
    Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;<br />
 teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and<br />
 spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<br />
 --Exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any<br />
 of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<br />
<br />
    Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account<br />
 in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be<br />
 justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.--Behold,<br />
 [it is] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will<br />
 recompense, even recompense into their bosom.<br />

 and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a tree planted by<br />
 the waters, and [that] spreadeth out her roots by the river, and<br />
 shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and<br />
 shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease<br />
 from yielding fruit.<br />
<br />
    I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the<br />
 low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry<br />
 tree to flourish.<br />
<br />
    The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall<br />
 grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that are planted in the<br />

 shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and<br />
 flourishing.<br />

 thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am<br />
 glorified in them.--Father, I will that they also, whom thou<br />
 hast given to me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my<br />
 glory, which thou hast given to me: for thou didst love me<br />
 before the foundation of the world.<br />

 to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all them<br />
 that believe . . . in that day.--We who are alive [and] remain<br />
 shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the<br />

 shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               I beseech thee, show me thy glory.<br />
<br />
    God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath<br />
 shone into our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of<br />
 the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.--The Word was made<br />
 flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory<br />
 as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br />
 . . . No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,<br />
 who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].<br />
<br />
    My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I<br />
 come and appear before God?--[When thou saidst], Seek ye my<br />
 face; my heart said to thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.<br />
<br />
    We all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory<br />
 of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to<br />
 glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.--Father, I will that<br />

<br />
       Upon the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness<br />
            as the appearance of a man above upon it.<br />
<br />
    The man Christ Jesus.--Made in the likeness of men. . . .<br />
 found in fashion as a man.--Since then the children are<br />
 partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part<br />
 of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had<br />
 the power of death.<br />
<br />
    I [am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive<br />
 for evermore.--Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;<br />
 death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he<br />
 died to sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God.--<br />
 [What] if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was<br />
 before?--He raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own<br />
 right hand in the heavenly [places].--In him dwelleth all the<br />
 fulness of the Godhead bodily.<br />
<br />
    Though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by<br />
 the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live<br />
 with him by the power of God.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                    Thy word hath revived me.<br />
<br />
    The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was<br />
 made] a living spirit.<br />
<br />
    As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the<br />
 Son to have life in himself.--I am the resurrection, and the<br />
 life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he<br />
 live: and whoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<br />
<br />
    In him was life; and the life was the light of men. . . . As<br />
 many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons<br />
 of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: who were born,<br />
 not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of<br />
 man, but of God.<br />
<br />
    It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth<br />
 nothing: the words that I speak to you, [they] are spirit, and<br />
 [they] are life.--The word of God [is] living, and powerful, and<br />
 sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing<br />
 asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and<br />
 [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Permit [it to be so] now: for thus it is<br />

<br />
    I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within<br />
 my heart.<br />
<br />
    Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:<br />
 I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say to<br />
 you, Till heaven and earth shall pass away, one jot or one<br />
 tittle shall by no means pass from the law, till all be<br />
 fulfilled.--The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness'<br />
 sake; he will magnify the law, and make [it] honourable.--Except<br />
 your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the<br />
 scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no way enter into the kingdom<br />
 of heaven.<br />
<br />
    What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the<br />
 flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,<br />
 and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness<br />
 of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the<br />
 flesh, but according to the Spirit.--Christ [is] the end of the<br />
 law for righteousness to every one that believeth.<br />

 cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines have fallen to me in<br />
 pleasant [places]; yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Who can say, I have made my heart clean?<br />
<br />
    The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to<br />
 see if there were any that did understand, [and] seek God. They<br />
 are all gone aside, they are [all] together become filthy:<br />
 [there is] none that doeth good, no, not one.--Then they that<br />
 are in the flesh cannot please God.<br />
<br />
    To will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which<br />
 is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the<br />
 evil which I would not, that I do.--We are all as an unclean<br />
 [thing], and all our righteousnesses [are] as filthy rags; and<br />
 we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,<br />
 have taken us away.<br />
<br />
    The scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise<br />
 by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.<br />
 --That God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not<br />
 imputing their trespasses to them.<br />
<br />
    If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the<br />
 truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and<br />
 just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all<br />
 unrighteousness.<br />

    The LORD on high [is] mightier than the noise of many waters,<br />
 [yea, than] the mighty waves of the sea.--O LORD God of hosts,<br />
 who [is] a strong LORD like thee? or to thy faithfulness around<br />
 thee? Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when its waves arise,<br />
 thou stillest them.<br />
<br />
    Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my<br />
 presence, who have placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea by<br />
 a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it?<br />

 little faith, why didst thou doubt?<br />

 highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every<br />
 name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.--In him<br />
 dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<br />
<br />
    If ye love me, keep my commandments.--The love of God is shed<br />
 abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.--<br />
 The house was filled with the odour of the ointment.--They took<br />
 knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<br />
<br />
    O LORD our Lord, how excellent [is] thy name in all the<br />
 earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.--Emmanuel . . .<br />
 God with us.--His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,<br />
 The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.--<br />
 The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous runneth<br />
 into it, and is safe.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
  We that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened.<br />
<br />
    Lord, all my desire [is] before thee; and my groaning is not<br />
 hid from thee. . . . My iniquities have gone over my head: as an<br />
 heavy burden they are too heavy for me.--O wretched man that I<br />
 am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<br />
<br />
    The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together<br />
 until now. And not only [they], but ourselves . . ., who have<br />
 the firstfruits of the Spirit, . . . groan within ourselves,<br />
 waiting for the adoption, [that is], the redemption of our body.<br />
 --Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through<br />
 various temptations.<br />
<br />
    Shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle.--For this<br />
 corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put<br />
 on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on<br />
 incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,<br />
 then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death<br />
 is swallowed up in victory.<br />

<br />
         The whole bull shall he carry forth outside the<br />
           camp to a clean place, where the ashes are<br />
         poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire.<br />
<br />
    They took Jesus, and led [him] away. And he bearing his cross<br />
 went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is<br />
 called in the Hebrew Golgotha: where they crucified him.--The<br />
 bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the<br />
 sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the<br />
 camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people<br />
 with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth<br />
 therefore to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.--The<br />
 fellowship of his sufferings.<br />
<br />
    Rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;<br />
 that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with<br />
 exceeding joy.--Our light affliction, which is but for a moment,<br />
 worketh out for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of<br />
 glory.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               God created man in his [own] image.<br />
<br />
    Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that<br />
 the Godhead is like gold, or silver, or stone, formed by art and<br />
 man's device.<br />
<br />
    God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he<br />
 loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath made us alive<br />
 together with Christ. . . . We are his workmanship, created in<br />
 Christ Jesus to good works, which God hath before ordained that<br />
 we should walk in them.--For whom he did foreknow, he also did<br />
 predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he<br />
 might be the firstborn among many brethren.<br />
<br />
    We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for<br />
 we shall see him as he is.--I shall be satisfied, when I awake,<br />
 with thy likeness.<br />
<br />
    He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be<br />
 his God, and he shall be my son. . . . If children, then heirs;<br />
 heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with<br />
 [him], that we may be glorified together.<br />

             Thou [art] my hope in the day of evil.<br />
<br />
    [There are] many that say, Who will show us [any] good? LORD,<br />
 lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance.--I will sing of<br />
 thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning:<br />
 for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my<br />
 trouble.<br />
<br />
    In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.--I cried to<br />
 thee, O LORD; and to the LORD I made supplication. What profit<br />
 [is there] in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the<br />
 dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? Hear, O LORD, and<br />
 have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.<br />
<br />
    For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great<br />
 mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from<br />
 thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have<br />
 mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.--Sorrow shall be<br />
 turned into joy.--Weeping may endure for a night, but joy<br />
 [cometh] in the morning.<br />

          Adam . . . begat [a son] in his own likeness.<br />

   Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean?--Behold, I<br />
 was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br />
<br />
    Dead in trespasses and sins; . . . by nature the children of<br />
 wrath, even as others.--I am carnal, sold under sin. That which<br />
 I do I understand not: for what I would, that I do not; but what<br />
 I hate, that I do.--For I know that in me (that is, in my<br />
 flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.<br />
<br />
    By one man sin entered into the world, . . . by one man's<br />
 disobedience many were made sinners.--If through the offence of<br />
 one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by<br />
 grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to<br />
 many.<br />
<br />
    The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me<br />
 free from the law of sin and death.<br />

 Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

<br />
    Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own<br />
 understanding.--If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of<br />
 God, who giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and<br />
 it shall be given to him.--The foolishness of God is wiser than<br />
 men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.--God hath<br />
 chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.--<br />
 That no flesh should glory in his presence.<br />
<br />
    The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth<br />
 understanding to the simple.--Thy word have I hid in my heart,<br />
 that I might not sin against thee.<br />
<br />
    All bore him testimony, and wondered at the gracious words<br />
 which proceeded out of his mouth.--Never man spoke like this<br />
 man.--Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us<br />
 wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.<br />

    Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall<br />

 gave up the ghost.--He hath made him [to be] sin for us, who<br />
 knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth<br />

    Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God: for<br />
 God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<br />
 but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust,<br />
 and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth<br />
 sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<br />
<br />
    [They] lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God<br />
 in the desert.<br />
<br />
    Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit . . . was led by the<br />
 Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted by the<br />
 devil. And in those days he ate nothing: and when they were<br />
 ended, he was afterward hungry. And the devil said to him, If<br />
 thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made<br />
 bread.<br />
<br />
    He himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to help<br />
 them that are tempted.--Simon, Simon, . . . Satan hath desired<br />

 prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.<br />

 mine.<br />
<br />
    Sanctified by God the Father.--Sanctify them through thy<br />
 truth: thy word is truth.--The very God of peace sanctify you<br />
 wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body may<br />
 be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
 Hebrews 13:12<br />

 iniquity, and purify to himself [his own] special people,<br />
 zealous of good works.--Both he that sanctifieth and they who<br />
 are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not<br />
 ashamed to call them brethren.--For their sakes I sanctify<br />
 myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth. . .<br />

 sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and<br />

 him the iniquity of us all.<br />

 curse of the law, being made a curse for us.<br />

 our sins.--That he may be just, and the justifier of him who<br />
 believeth in Jesus.<br />

    Yet ye have not, because ye ask not.<br />
<br />
    Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;<br />
 knock, and the door shall be opened to you: for every one that<br />
 asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that<br />
 knocketh the door shall be opened.--This is the confidence that<br />
 we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will,<br />
 he heareth us: and if we know that he heareth us, whatever we<br />
 ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired from<br />
 him.--If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who<br />
 giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall<br />
 be given to him.--I [am] the LORD thy God, who brought thee out<br />
 of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.--<br />
 Men ought always to pray, and not to faint;<br />
<br />
    The eyes of the LORD [are] upon the righteous, and his ears<br />
 [are open] to their cry.--[The righteous] cry, and the LORD<br />
 heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.--Ye<br />
 shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the<br />
 Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye<br />
 have loved me.-- Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be<br />
 full.<br />

<br />
            Shall we receive good at the hand of God,<br />
                 and shall we not receive evil?<br />
<br />
    I know, O LORD, that thy judgments [are] right, and [that]<br />
 thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.--O LORD, thou [art] our<br />
 father; we [are] the clay, and thou our potter; and we all [are]<br />
 the work of thy hand.--It [is] the LORD: let him do what seemeth<br />
 him good.<br />
<br />
    Righteous [art] thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let<br />
 me speak with thee of [thy] judgments.<br />
<br />
    He shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver.--Whom the<br />
 Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he<br />
 receiveth.--It is enough for the disciple that he should be as<br />
 his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called<br />
 the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they<br />
 call] them of his household?--Though he was a Son, yet he<br />
 learned obedience by the things which he suffered.<br />
<br />
    But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;<br />
 that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with<br />
 exceeding joy.--These are they who came out of the great<br />
 tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in<br />
 the blood of the Lamb.<br />

<br />
          Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.<br />
<br />
 When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the<br />
 LORD shall lift up a standard against him.--Be gone, Satan: for<br />
 it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only<br />
 shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold,<br />
 angels came and ministered to him.<br />
<br />
    Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on<br />
 the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against<br />
 the wiles of the devil.--And have no fellowship with the<br />
 unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].--Lest<br />
 Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of<br />
 his devices.--Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the<br />
 devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may<br />
 devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the<br />
 same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in<br />
 the world.--This is the victory that overcometh the world,<br />
 [even] our faith.<br />
<br />
    Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? [It<br />
 is] God that justifieth.<br />

              O that I knew where I might find him!<br />
<br />
    Who [is] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the<br />
 voice of his servant, that walketh [in] darkness, and hath no<br />
 light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and rely upon his<br />
 God.<br />
<br />
    Ye shall seek me, and find [me], when ye shall search for me<br />
 with all your heart.--Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and the<br />
 door shall be opened to you. For every one that asketh<br />
 receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh<br />
 the door shall be opened.<br />
<br />
    Truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son<br />
 Jesus Christ.--Now in Christ Jesus ye who once were far off are<br />
 made near by the blood of Christ.--For through him we both have<br />
 an access by one Spirit to the Father.<br />
<br />
    If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in<br />
 darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:<br />
<br />
    Lo, I am with you always.--I will never leave thee, nor<br />
 forsake thee.--The Comforter . . . dwelleth with you, and shall<br />
 be in you.<br />

 --Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the<br />
 hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom.--I thought on<br />
 my ways, and turned my feet to thy testimonies. I made haste,<br />
 and delayed not to keep thy commandments.--Let a man examine<br />
 himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that]<br />
 cup.<br />
<br />
    If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us<br />
 [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.--We have<br />
 an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.--Having<br />
 therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the<br />
 blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath<br />
 consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;<br />
 and [having] an high priest over the house of God; let us draw<br />
 near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our<br />
 hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed<br />
 with pure water.<br />

 look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant<br />
 between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is]<br />

 was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong<br />
 consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope<br />

<br />
    He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,<br />
 hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but<br />
 hath passed from death to life.--I through the law am dead to<br />
 the law, that I may live to God. I am crucified with Christ:<br />
 nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the<br />
 life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the<br />
 Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br />
<br />
    Because I live, ye shall live also.--I give to them eternal<br />
 life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them<br />
 out of my hand. My Father, who gave [them to] me, is greater<br />
 than all; and none is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's<br />
 hand. I and [my] Father are one.<br />
<br />
    If ye then be raised with Christ, seek those things which are<br />
 above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.--For ye<br />
 are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br />

 thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do<br />
 I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.<br />
<br />
    The grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one<br />
 man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to many. . . . The free gift<br />
 [is] of many offences to justification.<br />
<br />
    God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he<br />
 loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath made us alive<br />
 together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised<br />
 [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly<br />
 [places] in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might show<br />
 the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us<br />
 through Christ Jesus.<br />

           begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him<br />
          should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br />
<br />
    God . . . hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and<br />
 hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, that<br />
 God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing<br />
 their trespasses to them; and hath committed to us the word of<br />
 reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though<br />
 God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be<br />
 ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him [to be] sin for us,<br />
 who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God<br />
 in him.--God is love. In this was revealed the love of God toward<br />
 us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world,<br />
 that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we<br />
 loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the<br />
 propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought<br />
 also to love one another.<br />

 at her. . . . And they who heard [it], being convicted by [their<br />
 own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,<br />
 [even] to the last.<br />
<br />
    Who told thee that thou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the<br />
 tree, of which I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?<br />
<br />
    To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it<br />
 is sin.--If our heart condemneth us, God is greater than our<br />
 heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart doth not<br />
 condemn us, [then] have we confidence toward God.<br />
<br />
    All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man<br />
 who eateth with offence. . . . Happy [is] he that condemneth not<br />
 himself in what he approveth.<br />
<br />
    Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my<br />
 thoughts: and see if [there is any] wicked way in me, and lead<br />
 me in the way everlasting.<br />

<br />
    Behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day<br />
 of salvation.--Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk<br />
 while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he<br />
 that walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth. While ye<br />
 have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of<br />
 light.<br />
<br />
    Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for<br />
 [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the<br />
 grave, where thou goest.<br />
<br />
    Soul, thou hast abundance of goods laid up for many years;<br />

 layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.<br />

 away, and its lust: but he that doeth the will of God abideth<br />

 [he is] precious.--We love him, because he first loved us.--The<br />

 all, that they who live should not henceforth live to<br />
 themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.<br />

    There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary<br />
 be at rest. [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not<br />
 the voice of the oppressor.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:<br />
 . . . they . . . rest from their labours; and their works do<br />
 follow them.<br />
<br />
    Our friend Lazarus sleepeth. . . . Jesus spake of his death:<br />
 but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<br />
<br />
    We that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened.--<br />
 Ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even<br />
 we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,<br />
 [to wit], the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope:<br />
 but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why<br />
 doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, [then]<br />
 do we with patience wait for [it].<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not<br />
          unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways<br />
         acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.<br />
<br />
    Trust in him at all times; [ye] people, pour out your heart<br />
 before him: God [is] a refuge for us.<br />
<br />
    I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou<br />
 shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the<br />
 horse, [or] as the mule, [which] have no understanding: whose<br />
 mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near<br />
 unto thee. Many sorrows [shall be] to the wicked: but he that<br />
 trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.--Thine ears<br />
 shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This [is] the way, walk<br />
 ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to<br />
 the left.<br />
<br />
    And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me], carry<br />
 us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and<br />
 thy people have found grace in thy sight? [is it] not in that<br />
 thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people,<br />
 from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
      The prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt have treasure in heaven: . . . come [and] follow<br />
 me.--I [am] . . . thy exceeding great reward.<br />
<br />
    Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been<br />
 faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many<br />
 things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.--They shall reign<br />
 for ever and ever.<br />
<br />
    Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.-- The<br />
 crown of life.--A crown of righteousness.-- An incorruptible<br />
 [crown].<br />
<br />
    Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be<br />
 with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou<br />
 hast given me.--So shall we ever be with the Lord.<br />
<br />
    I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not<br />
 worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed<br />
 in us.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               Set your affection on things above,<br />
                   not on things on the earth.<br />
<br />
    Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the<br />
 world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not<br />
 in him.--Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where<br />
 moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and<br />
 steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where<br />
 neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not<br />
 break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will<br />
 your heart be also.<br />
<br />
    For we walk by faith, not by sight.--We faint not; but though<br />
 our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by<br />
 day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,<br />
 worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of<br />
 glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at<br />
 the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen<br />
 [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.<br />
 --To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that<br />
 fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.<br />

    Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name<br />
 of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of<br />
 patience.--Now all these things happened unto them for<br />
 ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom<br />
 the ends of the world are come.<br />
<br />
    Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not<br />
 receive evil?--Aaron held his peace.--It [is] the LORD: let him<br />
 do what seemeth him good.<br />
<br />
    Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee.--<br />
 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.<br />
<br />
    Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I<br />
 will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for<br />
 I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your<br />
 souls. For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.<br />
<br />
    Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the<br />
 heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hand of<br />
 their masters, [and] as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of<br />
 her mistress; so our eyes [wait] upon the LORD our God.--Hear my<br />
 cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth<br />
 will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to<br />
 the rock [that] is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter<br />
 for me, [and] a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in thy<br />
 tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings.--<br />
 Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the<br />
 needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm.<br />
<br />
    Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye<br />
 should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found<br />
 in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when<br />
 he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him<br />
 that judgeth righteously.<br />

<br />
                 Fight the good fight of faith.<br />
<br />
    We were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings,<br />
 within [were] fears.--Fear not: for they that [be] with us [are]<br />
 more than they that [be] with them.--Be strong in the Lord, and<br />
 in the power of his might.<br />
<br />
    Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a<br />
 shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the<br />
 God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.--God [is] my<br />
 strength [and] power . . . He teacheth my hands to war; so that<br />
 a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.--Our sufficiency [is] of<br />
 God.<br />
<br />
    The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear<br />
 him, and delivereth them.--Behold, the mountain [was] full of<br />
 horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<br />
<br />
    The time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of those] who<br />
 through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained<br />
 promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of<br />
 fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made<br />
 strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of<br />
 the aliens.<br />

           He . . . preserveth the way of his saints.<br />

    The LORD your God . . . went in the way before you, to search<br />
 you out a place to pitch your tents [in], in fire by night, to<br />
 shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.--As an<br />
 eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth<br />
 abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: [so]<br />
 the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange god with<br />
 him.--The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he<br />
 delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly<br />
 cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.--Many<br />
 [are] the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth<br />
 him out of them all.--For the LORD knoweth the way of the<br />
 righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.--We know<br />
 that all things work together for good to them that love God, to<br />
 them who are the called according to [his] purpose.--With him<br />
 [is] an arm of flesh; but with us [is] the LORD our God to help<br />
 us, and to fight our battles.<br />
<br />
    The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will<br />
 save, he will rejoice over thee with joy.<br />

 . . . For the transgression of my people was he stricken. . . .<br />
 It pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to grief.<br />
<br />
    Jesus our Lord . . . was delivered for our offences.--Christ<br />
 . . . hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that<br />
 he might bring us to God.--Who his own self bare our sins in his<br />
 own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live<br />
 unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.<br />
<br />
    He hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we<br />
 might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br />

 hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan. And<br />
 it shall be, [that] thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have<br />
 commanded the ravens to feed thee there.--8. And the word of the<br />
 LORD came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which<br />
 [belongeth] to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded<br />
 a widow woman there to sustain thee.<br />
<br />
    Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye<br />
 shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.--Your<br />
 heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br />
<br />
    Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto<br />
 thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he<br />
 shall direct thy paths.--Casting all your care upon him; for he<br />
 careth for you.<br />

 passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he<br />
 retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth [in]<br />
 mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he<br />
 will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins<br />
 into the depths of the sea.<br />
<br />
    For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great<br />
 mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from<br />
 thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have<br />
 mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. I will forgive their<br />

 his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and<br />
 renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly<br />
 through Jesus Christ our Saviour.--By grace are ye saved through<br />
 faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: not<br />
 of works, lest any man should boast.<br />

                  He feedeth among the lilies.<br />
<br />
    Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am<br />
 I in the midst of them.--If a man love me, he will keep my<br />
 words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,<br />
 and make our abode with him.<br />
<br />
    If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even<br />
 as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<br />
<br />
    Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant<br />
 fruits.--I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse: I<br />
 have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb<br />
 with my honey.--The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,<br />
 longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,<br />
 temperance.<br />
<br />
    Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so<br />
 shall ye be my disciples.--Every branch in me that beareth not<br />
 fruit he taketh away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he<br />
 purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.--Being filled<br />
 with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ,<br />
 unto the glory and praise of God.<br />

               The LORD bless thee, and keep thee.<br />

    The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no<br />
 sorrow with it.--Thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with<br />
 favour wilt thou compass him as [with] a shield.<br />
<br />
    He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee<br />
 will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither<br />
 slumber nor sleep. The LORD [is] thy keeper: the LORD [is] thy<br />
 shade upon thy right hand.--The LORD shall preserve thee from<br />
 all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The LORD shall preserve<br />
 thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even<br />
 for evermore.--I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every<br />
 moment: lest [any] hurt it, I will keep it night and day.<br />
<br />
    Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast<br />
 given me, that they may be one, as we [are]. While I was with<br />
 them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou<br />
 gavest me I have kept.<br />
<br />
    The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will<br />
 preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for<br />
 ever and ever. Amen.<br />

                           Jesus wept.<br />
<br />
    A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.--We have not an<br />
 high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our<br />
 infirmities.--It became him, for whom [are] all things, and by<br />
 whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make<br />
 the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.--<br />
 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things<br />
 which he suffered.<br />
<br />
    I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my<br />
 back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the<br />
 hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<br />
<br />
    Behold how he loved him!--He took not on [him the nature of]<br />
 angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in<br />
 all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren,<br />
 that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things<br />
 [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the<br />
 people.<br />

      unto thee: the LORD lift up his countenance upon thee,<br />
                      and give thee peace.<br />
<br />
    No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,<br />
 which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].--<br />
 The brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his<br />
 person.--The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them<br />
 which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of<br />
 Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.<br />
<br />
    Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy<br />
 mercies' sake. Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called<br />
 upon thee.--LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to<br />
 stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, [and] I was troubled.--<br />
 Blessed [is] the people that know the joyful sound: they shall<br />
 walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.<br />
<br />
    The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will<br />
 bless his people with peace.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
             Things that are pleasing in his sight.<br />
<br />
    Without faith [it is] impossible to please [him].--So then<br />
 they that are in the flesh cannot please God.--The LORD taketh<br />
 pleasure in his people.<br />
<br />
    This [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God<br />
 endure grief, suffering wrongfully.--If, when ye do well, and<br />
 suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with<br />
 God.--[The ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, . . . is in the<br />
 sight of God of great price.<br />
<br />
    Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth<br />
 [his] conversation [aright] will I shew the salvation of God.--<br />
 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him<br />
 with thanksgiving. [This] also shall please the LORD better than<br />
 an ox [or] bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<br />
<br />
    I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye<br />
 present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto<br />
 God, [which is] your reasonable service.<br />

            For [there is] one God, and one mediator<br />

<br />

 blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same.<br />
<br />
    Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:<br />
 for I [am] God, and [there is] none else.<br />
<br />
    We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the<br />
 righteous.--In Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are<br />
 made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace.--By his<br />
 own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having<br />
 obtained eternal redemption [for us].--And for this cause he is<br />
 the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for<br />
 the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first<br />
 testament, they which are called might receive the promise of<br />
 eternal inheritance.--He is able also to save them to the<br />
 uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to<br />
 make intercession for them.<br />

 strength.<br />
<br />
    Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee.--<br />
 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the<br />
 afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he<br />
 cried unto him, he heard.--Is any among you afflicted? let him<br />
 pray.<br />
<br />
    Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be<br />
 afraid.--Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or<br />
 what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put<br />
 on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br />
 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they<br />
 reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth<br />
 them. Are ye not much better than they?--Be not faithless, but<br />
 believing.--Lo, I am with you alway.<br />

 the name of Christ, happy [are ye]. . . But let none of you<br />
 suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or<br />
 as a busybody in other men's matters.--Be blameless and<br />
 harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a<br />
 crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in<br />
 the world.--Let your light so shine before men, that they may<br />
 see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br />

    Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy<br />
 neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: so shalt thou<br />
 find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br />

 things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if<br />

 sweeter] than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get<br />
 understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br />

 here, and watch with me. And he went a little further, and fell<br />
 on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible,<br />
 let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as<br />
 thou [wilt].--And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly:<br />
 and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down<br />
 to the ground.<br />
<br />
    The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat<br />
 hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.--Reproach hath broken<br />
 my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked [for some] to<br />
 take pity, but [there was] none; and for comforters, but I found<br />
 none.--I looked on [my] right hand, and beheld, but [there was]<br />
 no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my<br />
 soul.<br />
<br />
    He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and<br />
 acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from<br />
 him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br />

    The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament<br />
 sheweth his handywork.--By the word of the LORD were the heavens<br />
 made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.--For<br />
 he spake, and it was [done]; he commanded, and it stood fast.--<br />
 Behold, the nations [are] as a drop of a bucket, and are counted<br />
 as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles<br />

    My days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no<br />
 good. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle<br />

 flood; they are [as] a sleep: in the morning [they are] like<br />
 grass [which] groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth, and<br />
 groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.--Man<br />

 lust of the eyes), and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise<br />
 (the pride of life), she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,<br />
 and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.<br />
<br />
<br />
    When the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of<br />
 God, command that these stones be made bread (the lust of the<br />
 flesh). But he answered, . . . It is written, Man shall not<br />
 live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of<br />
 the mouth of God.--The devil sheweth him all the kingdoms of the<br />
 world, and the glory of them (the lust of the eyes, and the<br />

 are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh<br />
 that I had wings like a dove! [for then] would I fly away, and<br />
 be at rest.<br />
<br />
    Ye have need of patience.<br />
<br />
    While they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,<br />
 behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said,<br />
 Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same<br />
 Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in<br />
 like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.--Our<br />
 conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the<br />
 Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.--That blessed hope, and the<br />
 glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus<br />
 Christ.<br />

    I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep].--The foundation<br />

 depart from iniquity.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and<br />
 he knoweth them that trust in him.--Hurt not the earth, neither<br />
 the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our<br />
 God in their foreheads.<br />
<br />
    After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit<br />
 of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance.--Now he<br />
 which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us,<br />
 [is] God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the<br />
 Spirit in our hearts.<br />
<br />
    I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the<br />
 city of my God, [which is] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out<br />
 of heaven from my God: and [I will write upon him] my new name.<br />
 --This [is the name] wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our<br />
 righteousness.<br />

 which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again<br />
 unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the<br />
 dead.--Saved by his life.<br />
<br />
    Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . who gave himself for us, that<br />
 he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a<br />
 peculiar people, zealous of good works.--As he which hath called<br />
 you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;<br />
 because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.<br />
<br />
    The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . hath<br />
 blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in<br />
 Christ.--In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<br />
 And ye are complete in him.--Of his fulness have all we<br />
 received, and grace for grace.<br />
<br />
    He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us<br />
 all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<br />

    Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass<br />
 away.--Ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that<br />
 not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD<br />
 your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you,<br />
 [and] not one thing hath failed thereof.<br />
<br />
    Fear not: peace [be] unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.<br />
 And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said,<br />
 Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.--Be strong, .<br />

<br />
             The entrance of thy words giveth light.<br />
<br />
    This . . . is the message which we have heard of him, and<br />
 declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness<br />
 at all.--God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,<br />
 hath shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge<br />
 of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.--The Word was<br />
 God.--In him was life; and the life was the light of men.--If we<br />
 walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one<br />
 with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us<br />
 from all sin.<br />
<br />
    Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin<br />
 against thee.--Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken<br />
 unto you.<br />
<br />
    Ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the<br />
 Lord: walk as children of light.--Ye [are] a chosen generation,<br />
 a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye<br />
 should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of<br />
 darkness into his marvellous light.<br />

<br />
                      Noah was a just man.<br />

    The just shall live by faith.--Noah builded an altar unto the<br />
 LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl,<br />
 and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the LORD smelled a<br />
 sweet savour.--The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.<br />
<br />
    Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in<br />
 his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin. But now the<br />
 righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being<br />
 witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of<br />
 God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all<br />
 them that believe: for there is no difference.<br />
<br />
    We . . . joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we<br />
 have now received the atonement.--[It is] God that justifieth.--<br />
 Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and<br />
 whom he called, them he also justified.<br />

<br />
    The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and<br />
 watch unto prayer.--Be sober, be vigilant; because your<br />
 adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking<br />
 whom he may devour.--Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul<br />
 diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have<br />
 seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy<br />
 life.--The just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back,<br />
 my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them<br />
 who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the<br />
 saving of the soul.<br />
<br />
    What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.<br />
<br />
    Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; for I<br />

 yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br />

                Is his mercy clean gone for ever?<br />

 and of great mercy.--Who [is] a God like unto thee, that<br />
 pardoneth iniquity? . . . he retaineth not his anger for ever,<br />
 because he delighteth [in] mercy. He will turn again, he will<br />
 have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou<br />
 wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.--Not by<br />
 works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his<br />
 mercy he saved us.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br />
 the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who<br />
 comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to<br />
 comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith<br />
 we ourselves are comforted of God.<br />
<br />
    Merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to<br />

 that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to<br />
 succour them that are tempted.<br />

<br />
    Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man<br />
 soweth, that shall he also reap.--Remember Lot's wife.<br />
<br />
    Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what<br />
 fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what<br />
 communion hath light with darkness?--Wherefore come out from<br />
 among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not<br />
 the unclean [thing].--Be not ye . . . partakers with them. For<br />
 ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord:<br />
 walk as children of light: proving what is acceptable unto the<br />
 Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of<br />
 darkness, but rather reprove [them].<br />

 the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, [even]<br />

 righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.<br />

 feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground.<br />
 . . . I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God<br />
 of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he<br />

    He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but<br />
 was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully<br />
 persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to<br />
 perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.<br />

 to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we<br />

 be a performance of those things which were told her from the<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
         [The kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling<br />
            into a far country, [who] called his own<br />
          servants, and delivered unto them his goods<br />
      . . . to every man according to his several ability.<br />
<br />
    Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to<br />
 obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?<br />
<br />
    All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing<br />
 to every man severally as he will.--The manifestation of the<br />
 Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.--As every man<br />
 hath received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to<br />
 another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.--It is<br />
 required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.--Unto<br />
 whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to<br />
 whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] sufficient for these things?--I can do all things<br />
 through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br />

            Distributing to the necessity of saints.<br />
<br />
    David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of<br />
 Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?<br />
<br />
    Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared<br />
 for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred,<br />
 and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was<br />
 a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was<br />
 sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.--<br />
 Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of these my<br />
 brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.--Whosoever shall give to<br />
 drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only<br />
 in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no<br />
 wise lose his reward.<br />
<br />
    To do good and to communicate forget not: for with such<br />
 sacrifices God is well pleased.--God [is] not unrighteous to<br />
 forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward<br />
 his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do<br />
 minister.<br />

<br />
  To him that soweth righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.<br />
<br />
    After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and<br />
 reckoneth with them. And so he that had received five talents<br />
 came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou<br />
 deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside<br />
 them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done,<br />
 [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a<br />
 few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou<br />
 into the joy of thy lord.<br />
<br />
    We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that<br />
 every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according<br />
 to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.<br />
<br />
    I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I<br />
 have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown<br />
 of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall<br />
 give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also<br />
 that love his appearing.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that<br />
 no man take thy crown.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                           God [is] faithful.<br />
<br />
    God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of<br />
 man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do<br />
 [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?--The<br />
 Lord sware and will not repent.<br />
<br />
    od, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise<br />
 the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath: that<br />
 by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to<br />
 lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for<br />
 refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.--Wherefore let<br />
 them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping<br />
 of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful<br />
 Creator.<br />
<br />
    I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able<br />
 to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.--<br />
 Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].--All<br />
 the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the<br />
 glory of God by us.<br />

<br />
    The LORD [is] my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?<br />
 the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be<br />
 afraid?--He giveth power to the faint; and to [them that have]<br />
 no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and<br />
 be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that<br />
 wait upon the LORD shall renew [their] strength; they shall<br />
 mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;<br />
 [and] they shall walk, and not faint.--My flesh and my heart<br />
 faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my portion<br />
 for ever.<br />
<br />
    If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?--The LORD [is]<br />
 on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?--Through<br />
 thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we<br />
 tread them under that rise up against us.--We are more than<br />
 conquerors through him that loved us.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                   Our friend . . . sleepeth.<br />
<br />
    I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning<br />
 them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which<br />
 have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,<br />
 even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<br />
<br />
    If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if<br />
 Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your<br />
 sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are<br />
 perished.--Now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the<br />
 firstfruits of them that slept.<br />
<br />
    It came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over<br />
 Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, . . . Take you<br />
 hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the<br />
 priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, . . . and these stones<br />
 shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.--<br />
 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.--<br />
 Witnesses chosen before of God, . . . who did eat and drink with<br />
 him after he rose from the dead.<br />

 world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath<br />
 promised to them that love him?--Heirs of God, and joint-heirs<br />
 with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be<br />
 also glorified together.<br />

 is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for<br />
 them a city.<br />

 shall gather them.--Set your affection on things above, not on<br />
 things on the earth.--Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon<br />
 earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break<br />
 through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in<br />
 heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where<br />
 thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure<br />
 is, there will your heart be also.<br />

<br />
    Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be<br />
 acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.<br />
<br />
   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon<br />
 and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou<br />
 art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br />
 --The works of the LORD [are] great, sought out of all them that<br />
 have pleasure therein.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [is] the man that walketh not in the counsel of the<br />
 ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the<br />
 seat of the scornful. But his delight [is] in the law of the<br />
 LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.--This book<br />
 of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt<br />
 meditate therein day and night.--My soul shall be satisfied as<br />
 [with] marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise [thee] with<br />
 joyful lips: when I remember thee upon my bed, [and] meditate on<br />
 thee in the [night] watches.<br />

         How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever?<br />

<br />
    Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and<br />
 cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no<br />
 variableness, neither shadow of turning.--But Zion said, The<br />
 LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a<br />
 woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have<br />
 compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet<br />
 will I not forget thee.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt not be forgotten of me. I have blotted out, as a<br />
 thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins.<br />
<br />
    Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had<br />

 yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or<br />

 were evil.--Ye are all the children of light, and the children<br />
 of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.<br />

    Darkness hath blinded his eyes.--Thy word [is] a lamp unto my<br />
 feet, and a light unto my path.<br />
<br />
    The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of<br />
 cruelty.--Love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of<br />
 God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for<br />
 God is love.<br />

<br />
                   When the Son of man cometh,<br />
                shall he find faith on the earth?<br />
<br />
    He came unto his own, and his own received him not.--The<br />
 Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall<br />
 depart from the faith.<br />
<br />
    Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;<br />
 reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For<br />
 the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but<br />
 after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers,<br />
 having itching ears; and they shall turn away [their] ears from<br />
 the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.<br />
<br />
    Of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no, not the<br />
 angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.<br />
 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.<br />
 --Blessed [are] those servants, whom the lord when he cometh<br />
 shall find watching.--Looking for that blessed hope, . . . the<br />
 glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus<br />
 Christ.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one<br />
        day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a<br />
        thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack<br />
       concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.<br />
<br />
    My thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither [are] your ways<br />
 my ways, saith the LORD. For [as] the heavens are higher than<br />
 the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts<br />
 than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow<br />
 from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth,<br />
 . . . so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it<br />
 shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that<br />
 which I please, and it shall prosper [in the thing] whereto I<br />
 sent it.<br />
<br />
    God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have<br />
 mercy upon all. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and<br />
 knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his<br />
 ways past finding out!<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
       Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning.<br />
<br />
    The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised<br />
 the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring<br />
 fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?--We<br />
 had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust<br />
 in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered<br />
 us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust<br />
 that he will yet deliver [us].--The wages of sin [is] death; but<br />
 the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />
<br />
    [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living<br />
 God.--Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.<br />
<br />
    Be instant in season, out of season.--Others save with fear,<br />
 pulling [them] out of the fire.<br />
<br />
    Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD<br />
 of hosts.--Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto<br />
 the knowledge of the truth.<br />

<br />
    Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and<br />
 that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and<br />
 tempest, . . . but ye are come unto mount Sion, . . . to God the<br />
 Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and<br />
 to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.--Jesus the author and<br />
 finisher of [our] faith.--We have not an high priest which<br />
 cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was<br />
 in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. Let us<br />
 therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may<br />
 obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the<br />
 LORD of hosts; I [am] the first, and I [am] the last; and beside<br />
 me [there is] no God.--The mighty God, The everlasting Father,<br />
 The Prince of Peace.<br />
<br />
    [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy<br />
 One?--Who [is] God, save the LORD? and who [is] a rock, save<br />
 our God?<br />

          Lead me to the rock [that] is higher than I.<br />
<br />
    Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and<br />
 supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known<br />
 unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,<br />
 shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest<br />
 my path.--He knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried<br />
 me, I shall come forth as gold.--Lord, thou hast been our<br />
 dwelling place in all generations.--Thou hast been a strength to<br />
 the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from<br />
 the storm, a shadow from the heat.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] a rock save our God?--They shall never perish,<br />
 neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.--Uphold me<br />
 according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be<br />
 ashamed of my hope.--Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the<br />
 soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that<br />
 within the veil.<br />

 with me; [and] he shall make peace with me.<br />
<br />
    O woman, great [is] thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou<br />
 wilt.--According to your faith be it unto you.--Let him ask in<br />
 faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of<br />
 the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man<br />
 think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br />
<br />
    They drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and<br />
 [Jesus] made as though he would have gone further. But they<br />
 constrained him, saying, Abide with us: . . . he vanished out of<br />
 their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart<br />
 burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he<br />
 opened to us the scriptures?--I pray thee, if I have found grace<br />
 in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I<br />
 may find grace in thy sight.--My presence shall go [with thee],<br />
 and I will give thee rest.<br />

 Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the<br />

 generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with<br />
 the last; I [am] he.<br />
<br />
    Sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,<br />
 [and] called.--The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I<br />
 pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved<br />
 blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful<br />
 [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].--He which hath<br />
 begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of<br />
 Jesus Christ.--Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit,<br />
 are ye now made perfect by the flesh?--The LORD will perfect<br />
 [that which] concerneth me.<br />
<br />
    For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of<br />
 [his] good pleasure.<br />

    Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, . . .<br />
 who also maketh intercession for us.--Christ is not entered into<br />
 the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the<br />
 true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of<br />
 God for us.<br />
<br />
    If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus<br />
 Christ the righteous.--[There is] one God, and one mediator<br />
 between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Seeing . . . that we have a great high priest, that is passed<br />
 into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our]<br />
 profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be<br />
 touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all<br />
 points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. Let us<br />
 therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may<br />
 obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.--Through<br />
 him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.<br />

 will make mention of thy righteousness, [even] of thine only.<br />

 know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man<br />
 that walketh to direct his steps.<br />

    The mighty God, The everlasting Father.--I know whom I have<br />

 faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous<br />
 runneth into it, and is safe.--Woe to them that go down to Egypt<br />

 he will preserve it.<br />

   As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many<br />

 [so], but we glory in tribulations also. I am filled with<br />

 Believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<br />
<br />
    In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and<br />
 their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<br />
 --Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this<br />
 grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the<br />
 unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all [men] see what<br />
 [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of<br />
 the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus<br />
 Christ.<br />
<br />
    Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and<br />
 heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love<br />
 him?--God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that<br />
 ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to<br />
 every good work.<br />

 his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed<br />
 them; and he bare them, and carried them.--He whom thou lovest<br />

 made perfect in weakness.<br />
<br />
    Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities,<br />
 that the power of Christ may rest upon me.--I can do all things<br />
 through Christ which strengtheneth me.<br />

    We faint not; . . . though our outward man perish, yet the<br />

 power to the faint; and to [them that have] no might he<br />
 increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary,<br />
 and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon<br />
 the LORD shall renew [their] strength.--The eternal God [is thy]<br />

 what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.--Let the word of<br />

 heaven . . . the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which<br />

<br />
                    I [am] black, but comely.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother<br />
 conceive me.--Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy<br />
 beauty: for it [was] perfect through my comeliness, which I had<br />
 put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.<br />
<br />
    I am a sinful man, O Lord.--Behold, thou [art] fair, my love;<br />
 behold, thou [art] fair.<br />
<br />
    I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.--Thou [art]<br />
 all fair, my love; [there is] no spot in thee.<br />
<br />
    When I would do good, evil is present with me.--Be of good<br />
 cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<br />
<br />
    I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good<br />
 thing.--Ye are complete in him.--Perfect in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are<br />
 justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of<br />
 our God.--That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath<br />
 called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            All that will live godly in Christ Jesus<br />
                    shall suffer persecution.<br />
<br />
    I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and<br />
 the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against<br />
 her mother in law. And a man's foes [shall be] they of his own<br />
 household.--Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is<br />
 the enemy of God.--Love not the world, neither the things [that<br />
 are] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the<br />
 Father is not in him. For all that [is] in the world, the lust<br />
 of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,<br />
 is not of the Father, but is of the world.<br />
<br />
    If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it<br />
 hated] you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his<br />
 own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you<br />
 out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the<br />
 word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his<br />
 lord.--I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated<br />
 them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the<br />
 world.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
        In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:<br />
           but he that refraineth his lips [is] wise.<br />
<br />
    My beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to<br />
 speak, slow to wrath.--[He that is] slow to anger [is] better<br />
 than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that<br />
 taketh a city.--In many things we offend all. If any man offend<br />
 not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to<br />
 bridle the whole body.--By thy words thou shalt be justified,<br />
 and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.--Set a watch, O LORD,<br />
 before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.<br />
<br />
    For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also<br />
 suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow<br />
 his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:<br />
 who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,<br />
 he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth<br />
 righteously.--Consider him that endured such contradiction of<br />
 sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your<br />
 minds.<br />
<br />
    In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault<br />
 before the throne of God.<br />

<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                    Teach me thy way, O LORD.<br />
<br />
    I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou<br />
 shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.--Good and upright<br />
 [is] the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The<br />
 meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his<br />
 way.<br />
<br />
    I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,<br />
 and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br />
<br />
    Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:<br />
 no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.--Having. . . boldness<br />
 to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and<br />
 living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil,<br />
 that is to say, his flesh; and [having] an high priest over the<br />
 house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full<br />
 assurance of faith.<br />
<br />
    Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know the LORD.--All<br />
 the paths of the LORD [are] mercy and truth unto such as keep<br />
 his covenant and his testimonies.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      What the law could not do, in that it was weak through<br />
      the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of<br />
      sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.<br />
<br />
    The law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the<br />
 very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which<br />
 they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto<br />
 perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered?--By<br />
 him all that believe are justified from all things, from which<br />
 ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.<br />
<br />
    Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and<br />
 blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that<br />
 through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,<br />
 that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death<br />
 were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily he took<br />
 not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed<br />
 of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made<br />
 like unto [his] brethren.<br />

<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
      All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.<br />
<br />
    There is none righteous, no, not one. . . . there is none<br />
 that doeth good, no, not one.--[There is] not a just man upon<br />
 earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.--How can he be clean<br />
 [that is] born of a woman?<br />
<br />
    Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of<br />
 entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of<br />
 it.<br />
<br />
    I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before<br />
 me.--Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother<br />
 conceive me.<br />
<br />
    The LORD . . . hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.--<br />
 Whom he justified, them he also glorified.--We all, with open<br />
 face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed<br />
 into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit<br />
 of the Lord.--If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled,<br />
 and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel.<br />
<br />
    Walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and<br />
 glory.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               Honour the LORD with thy substance,<br />
         and with the firstfruits of all thine increase.<br />
<br />
    He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he<br />
 which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.--Upon the<br />
 first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in<br />
 store, as [God] hath prospered him.<br />
<br />
    God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of<br />
 love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have<br />
 ministered to the saints, and do minister.<br />
<br />
    I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye<br />
 present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto<br />
 God, [which is] your reasonable service.--The love of Christ<br />
 constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for<br />
 all, then were all dead: and [that] he died for all, that they<br />
 which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto<br />
 him which died for them, and rose again.--Whether therefore ye<br />
 eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.<br />

 thy glory.<br />
<br />
    The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to<br />
 shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb<br />
 [is] the light thereof.--They need no candle, neither light of<br />
 the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.<br />
<br />
    Ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy<br />
 nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises<br />
 of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous<br />
 light.--Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet<br />
 to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who<br />
 hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath<br />
 translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son.--Ye were<br />
 sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as<br />
 children of light.<br />
<br />
    We are not of the night, nor of darkness.<br />
<br />
    The path of the just [is] as the shining light, that shineth<br />
 more and more unto the perfect day.<br />

<br />
    How precious . . . are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great<br />
 is the sum of them!--How sweet are thy words unto my taste!<br />
 [yea, sweeter] than honey to my mouth!--Let him kiss me with the<br />
 kisses of his mouth: for thy love [is] better than wine.<br />

 earth [that] I desire beside thee.--Thou art fairer than the<br />

 delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste. He brought me to<br />
 the banqueting house, and his banner over me [was] love.--His<br />
 countenance [is] as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth<br />
 [is] most sweet: yea, he [is] altogether lovely. This [is] my<br />
 beloved, and this [is] my friend.<br />

    Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though<br />
 your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though<br />

<br />
    Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:<br />
 who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy<br />
 diseases.--He restoreth my soul.--O LORD, I will praise thee:<br />
 though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and<br />
 thou comfortedst me.<br />
<br />
    Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.<br />

 a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found<br />

 in the day [that] I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.<br />
<br />
    Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no<br />

 man, with bands of love.--I, if I be lifted up from the earth,<br />
 will draw all [men] unto me.--Behold the Lamb of God!--As Moses<br />
 lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of<br />
 man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not<br />
 perish, but have eternal life.<br />
<br />
    Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon<br />
 earth [that] I desire beside thee.--We love him, because he<br />
 first loved us.<br />
<br />
    My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair<br />
 one, and come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is<br />
 over [and] gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of<br />
 the singing [of birds] is come, and the voice of the turtle is<br />
 heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs,<br />
 and the vines [with] the tender grape give a [good] smell.<br />
 Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               I will raise them up a Prophet from<br />
              among their brethren, like unto thee.<br />
<br />
    [Moses] stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew<br />
 you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid.--[There is] one<br />
 God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Now the man Moses [was] very meek, above all the men which<br />
 [were] upon the face of the earth.--Take my yoke upon you, and<br />
 learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find<br />
 rest unto your souls.--Let this mind be in you, which was also<br />
 in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not<br />
 robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation,<br />
 and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the<br />
 likeness of men.<br />
<br />
    Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant,<br />
 for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;<br />
 but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if<br />
 we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm<br />
 unto the end.<br />

<br />
                    Everlasting consolation.<br />
<br />
    I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy<br />
 youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.<br />
<br />
    By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are<br />
 sanctified.--He is able also to save them to the uttermost that<br />
 come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession<br />
 for them.--I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he<br />
 is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against<br />
 that day.<br />
<br />
    The gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.--Who<br />
 shall separate us from the love of Christ?--The Lamb which is in<br />
 the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them<br />
 unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all<br />
 tears from their eyes.--So shall we ever be with the Lord.<br />
 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<br />
<br />
    This [is] not [your] rest.--Here have we no continuing city,<br />
 but we seek one to come.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
  Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br />
<br />
    The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the<br />
 bottom.--Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for<br />
 the unjust, that he might bring us to God.--The way into the<br />
 holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first<br />
 tabernacle was yet standing.<br />
<br />
    I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,<br />
 and shall go in and out, and find pasture.<br />
<br />
    No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.--Through him we<br />
 both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye<br />
 are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with<br />
 the saints, and of the household of God.--Having, . . .<br />
 brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of<br />
 Jesus, 20  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated<br />
 for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.--We have<br />
 peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we<br />
 have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and<br />
 rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<br />

         [His word] was in mine heart as a burning fire<br />

                     and I could not [stay].<br />
<br />
    Necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach<br />
 not the gospel! . . . What is my reward then? [Verily] that,<br />
 when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ<br />
 without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.--They<br />
 called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in<br />
 the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said unto<br />
 them, . . . We cannot but speak the things which we have seen<br />
 and heard.--The love of Christ constraineth us.<br />
<br />
    I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. . . .<br />
 [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, . . . thou oughtest<br />
 therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at<br />
 my coming I should have received mine own with usury.<br />
<br />
    Go . . . to thy friends, and tell them how great things the<br />
 Lord hath done for thee.<br />

<br />
 There shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand.<br />
<br />
    Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,<br />
 and touch not the unclean [thing].--Dearly beloved, I beseech<br />
 [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts,<br />
 which war against the soul.--Hating even the garment spotted by<br />
 the flesh.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet<br />
 appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,<br />
 we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every<br />
 man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is<br />
 pure.--The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to<br />
 all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly<br />
 lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this<br />
 present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious<br />
 appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who<br />
 gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,<br />
 and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good<br />
 works.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              Who art thou, Lord? . . . I am Jesus.<br />
<br />
    It is I; be not afraid.--When thou passest through the<br />
 waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they<br />
 shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire,<br />
 thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon<br />
 thee. For I [am] the LORD thy God, . . . thy Saviour.<br />
<br />
    Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I<br />
 will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff<br />
 they comfort me.--Emmanuel, . . . God with us.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people<br />
 from their sins.--If any man sin, we have an advocate with the<br />
 Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.--Who [is] he that<br />
 condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen<br />
 again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh<br />
 intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of<br />
 Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or<br />
 famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<br />

                     Stand fast in the Lord.<br />

    My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not<br />
 declined.<br />
<br />
    The LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they<br />
 are preserved for ever.--The LORD shall preserve thee from all<br />
 evil: he shall preserve thy soul.<br />
<br />
    The just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my<br />
 soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who<br />
 draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving<br />
 of the soul.--If they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have<br />
 continued with us: but [they went out], that they might be made<br />
 manifest that they were not all of us.<br />

    Having made peace through the blood of his cross, . . . You,<br />
 that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by<br />
 wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his<br />
 flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and<br />
 unreproveable in his sight.--In Christ Jesus ye who sometimes<br />
 were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.<br />
<br />
    If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the<br />
 death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved<br />
 by his life. And not only [so], but we also joy in God through<br />
 our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus<br />

       If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice of the herd,<br />
      let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer<br />
    it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle<br />
      of the congregation before the LORD. And he shall put<br />
    his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall<br />
         be accepted for him to make atonement for him.<br />
<br />
    God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.--Behold<br />
 the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.--We are<br />
 sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once<br />
 [for all].--A ransom for many.<br />
<br />
    No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have<br />
 power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.-- I<br />
 will love them freely. The Son of God . . . loved me and gave<br />
 himself for me.<br />

 might be made the righteousness of God in him.--He hath made us<br />

 themselves in the multitude of their riches; none [of them] can<br />

    He [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for<br />
 our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him;<br />
 and with his stripes we are healed. . . . The LORD hath laid on<br />
 him the iniquity of us all.--Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, .<br />
 . . that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in<br />
 his name among all nations.--He appeared to put away sin by the<br />
 sacrifice of himself.<br />
<br />
    Him hath God exalted with his right hand [to be] a Prince and<br />
 a Saviour, . . . to give repentance.--Through this man is<br />
 preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that<br />
 believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not<br />
 be justified by the law of Moses.--Your sins are forgiven you<br />
 for his name's sake.<br />

     Our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . though he was rich, . . .<br />
     became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.<br />
<br />
    It pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell.<br />
 --The brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his<br />
 person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when<br />
 he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of<br />
 the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels,<br />
 as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than<br />
 they.--Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to<br />
 be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation.<br />
<br />
    The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests;<br />
 but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.<br />
<br />
    All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or<br />
 the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to<br />
 come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.<br />

    Underneath [are] the everlasting arms.--When [Peter] saw the<br />
 wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,<br />
 saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth<br />
 [his] hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little<br />
 faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?--The steps of a [good] man<br />
 are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. Though he<br />
 fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth<br />
 [him with] his hand.<br />
<br />
    The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; [and<br />
 the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell<br />
 between his shoulders.--Casting all your care upon him; for he<br />
 careth for you.--He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his<br />
 eye.<br />
<br />
    They shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them<br />
 out of my hand. My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than<br />
 all.<br />

    Christ . . . loved the church, and gave himself for it; that<br />
 he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by<br />
 the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,<br />
 not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it<br />
 should be holy and without blemish.<br />
<br />
    There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with<br />
 the sun.--The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath<br />
 made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be<br />
 arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is<br />
 the righteousness of saints.--The righteousness of God [which<br />

                 Brethren, the time [is] short.<br />
<br />
    Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full of<br />
 trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he<br />
 fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.--The world passeth<br />
 away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God<br />
 abideth for ever.-As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall<br />
 all be made alive.--Death is swallowed up in victory.--Whether<br />
 we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto<br />
 the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<br />
 --To live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.<br />
<br />
    Cast not away . . . your confidence, which hath great<br />
 recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after<br />
 ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For<br />
 yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will<br />
 not tarry.--The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us<br />
 therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the<br />
 armour of light.--The end of all things is at hand: be ye<br />
 therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.<br />

                           A new name.<br />
<br />
    The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.--Let<br />
 every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.--<br />
 They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the<br />
 affections and lusts.--Ye are bought with a price: therefore<br />
 glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br />
<br />
    God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord<br />
 Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto<br />
 the world. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any<br />
 thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.<br />
<br />
    Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children; and walk in<br />
 love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for<br />
 us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling<br />
 savour. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness,<br />
 let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints.--Now<br />
 [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                     Behold the Lamb of God.<br />
<br />
    [It is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats<br />
 should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world,<br />
 he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body<br />
 hast thou prepared me: in burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for<br />
 sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the<br />
 volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.<br />
 --He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his<br />
 mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep<br />
 before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.<br />
<br />
    Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,<br />
 [as] silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of<br />
 Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: . . .<br />
 manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in<br />
 God, . . . that your faith and hope might be in God.<br />
<br />
    Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and<br />
 riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and<br />
 blessing.<br />

<br />
                    I will hope continually,<br />

<br />
    Not as though I had already attained, either were already<br />
 perfect.--Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let<br />
 us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of<br />
 repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.--The path<br />
 of the just [is] as the shining light, that shineth more and<br />
 more unto the perfect day.<br />
<br />
    I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my<br />
 supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,<br />
 therefore will I call upon [him] as long as I live.--I will<br />
 bless the LORD at all times: his praise [shall] continually [be]<br />
 in my mouth.<br />
<br />
    Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion.--They rest not day<br />
 and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.--Whoso<br />
 offereth praise glorifieth me.--Rejoice evermore. Pray without<br />
 ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God<br />
 in Christ Jesus concerning you.--Rejoice in the Lord alway:<br />
 [and] again I say, Rejoice.<br />

        Consider how great [things] he hath done for you.<br />

 thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and]<br />
 to prove thee, to know what [was] in thine heart, whether thou<br />
 wouldest keep his commandments, or no. . . . Thou shalt also<br />
 consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so]<br />
 the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.<br />
<br />
    I know, O LORD, that thy judgments [are] right, and [that]<br />
 thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.--[It is] good for me<br />
 that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.--<br />
 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy<br />
 word.--The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me<br />
 over unto death.--He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor<br />
 rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is<br />
 high above the earth, [so] great is his mercy toward them that<br />
 fear him.--He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we [are]<br />
 dust.<br />

 stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither<br />
 the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus.--Whom the heaven<br />
 must receive until the times of restitution of all things.--When<br />
 he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired<br />
 in all them that believe.<br />
<br />
    The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together<br />
 until now. And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have<br />
 the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within<br />
 ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of<br />
 our body.--Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not<br />
 yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall<br />
 appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.--<br />
 When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also<br />
 appear with him in glory.<br />

 the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to<br />
 do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his<br />
 sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and<br />

 Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our<br />
 abode with him.--Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever<br />
 sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children,<br />
 let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is<br />
 righteous, even as he is righteous.--Herein is our love made<br />

      [He that is] slow to wrath [is] of great understanding.<br />

 LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering.--The Lord is not<br />
 slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but<br />
 is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish,<br />
 but that all should come to repentance.<br />
<br />
    Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children; and walk in<br />
 love.--The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,<br />
 longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,<br />
 temperance: against such there is no law.--This [is]<br />
 thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,<br />
 suffering wrongfully. For what glory [is it], if, when ye be<br />
 buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if,<br />
 when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye take it patiently, this<br />
 [is] acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called:<br />
 because Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us an example,<br />
 that ye should follow his steps. . . . who, when he was reviled,<br />
 reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but<br />
 committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously.<br />

    Be ye angry, and sin not.<br />

 drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is<br />
 the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have<br />
 erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many<br />
 sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things.<br />
<br />
    If riches increase, set not your heart [upon them].--My fruit<br />
 [is] better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than<br />
 choice silver.<br />
<br />
    Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.--The<br />
 LORD looketh on the heart.<br />

       even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.<br />
<br />
    I [am] the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.<br />
 --Ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD [am] holy, and have<br />
 severed you from [other] people, that ye should be mine.<br />
<br />
    Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your<br />
 body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br />
<br />
    Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality<br />
 and power.--Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us<br />
 from all iniquity.--Be diligent that ye may be found of him in<br />
 peace, without spot, and blameless.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [are] the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law<br />
 of the LORD.--Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and<br />
 continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a<br />
 doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.--Search<br />
 me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and<br />
 see if [there be any] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way<br />
 everlasting.<br />

    Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the<br />

 that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live<br />
 soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.--Let<br />
 your light so shine before men, that they may see your good<br />
 works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.--Not as<br />
 though I had already attained, either were already perfect.<br />
<br />
    Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even<br />
 as he is pure.<br />
<br />
    Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God,<br />
 who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.--For the<br />
 perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the<br />
 edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of<br />
 the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a<br />
 perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of<br />
 Christ.<br />

    In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, [and]<br />
 strengthenedst me [with] strength in my soul.--Whiles I [was]<br />
 speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the<br />
 vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me<br />
 about the time of the evening oblation.<br />
<br />
    Hide not thy face [far] from me; put not thy servant away in<br />
 anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me,<br />
 O God of my salvation.--Be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my<br />
 strength, haste thee to help me.<br />
<br />
    Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth<br />
 by thy great power and stretched out arm, [and] there is nothing<br />
 too hard for thee.--Who delivered us from so great a death, and<br />
 doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us].--<br />
 Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto<br />
 him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will<br />
 avenge them speedily.<br />

    Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And<br />
 they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.--This<br />
 sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the<br />
 Son of God might be glorified thereby.--Said I not unto thee,<br />
 that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of<br />
 God?<br />
<br />
    Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God<br />
 and man.--Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.--<br />
 All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which<br />
 proceeded out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
    Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals<br />
 thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy<br />

 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall<br />
 reign on the earth.<br />

 them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:<br />
 but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good [thing].--<br />
 No good [thing] will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.<br />
 O LORD of hosts, blessed [is] the man that trusteth in thee.<br />
<br />
    I would have you without carefulness.--Be careful for<br />
 nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with<br />
 thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br />

 how is it that ye have no faith?--Have faith in God.<br />

 coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.--The LORD<br />
 went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the<br />
 way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go<br />
 by day and night: he took not away the pillar of the cloud by<br />

    God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not<br />
 imputing their trespasses unto them.--Whom God hath set forth<br />
 [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare<br />
 his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,<br />
 through the forbearance of God; to declare, [I say], at this<br />
 time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier<br />
 of him which believeth in Jesus.--He [was] wounded for our<br />
 transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the<br />
 chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes<br />
 we are healed.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's<br />
 elect? [It is] God that justifieth.--To him that worketh not,<br />
 but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is<br />
 counted for righteousness.<br />

 How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?<br />

    Beloved, now are we the sons of God, . . . it doth not yet<br />
 appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,<br />
 we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.--As we have<br />
 borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of<br />
 the heavenly.<br />
<br />
    The Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: . . . shall change our<br />
 vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,<br />
 according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all<br />
 things unto himself.<br />
<br />
    Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto<br />
 them, Peace [be] unto you. But they were terrified and<br />
 affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.--He was<br />
 seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of<br />
 above five hundred brethren at once.<br />
<br />
    If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell<br />
 in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also<br />
 quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<br />

 removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of<br />
 the sea; [though] the waters thereof roar [and] be troubled,<br />
 [though] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.--Come,<br />
 my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors<br />
 about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until<br />
 the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the LORD cometh out of<br />
 his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their<br />
 iniquity.-- In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge,<br />

 is he that smote thee?--Likewise also the chief priests mocking<br />
 [him], with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others;<br />
 himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now<br />
 come down from the cross.--Of a truth against thy holy child<br />
 Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate,<br />
 with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered<br />
 together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel<br />
 determined before to be done.<br />

 --I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation,<br />
 and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his<br />
 Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which<br />
 accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him<br />
 by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;<br />
 and they loved not their lives unto the death.<br />
<br />
    Thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through<br />
 our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              Vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity.<br />
<br />
    We spend our years as a tale [that is told]. The days of our<br />
 years [are] threescore years and ten; and if by reason of<br />
 strength [they be] fourscore years, yet [is] their strength<br />
 labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br />
<br />
    If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all<br />
 men most miserable.--Here have we no continuing city, but we<br />
 seek one to come.--I [am] the LORD, I change not.--Our<br />
 conversation [citizenship] is in heaven; from whence also we<br />
 look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change<br />
 our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious<br />
 body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue<br />
 all things unto himself.--The creature was made subject to<br />
 vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected<br />
 [the same] in hope.<br />
<br />
    Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.--<br />
 Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is<br />
 to come.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
              Awake to righteousness, and sin not.<br />
<br />
    Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the<br />
 day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us<br />
 not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.<br />
<br />
    [It is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our<br />
 salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent,<br />
 the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of<br />
 darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.--Wherefore take<br />
 unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to<br />
 withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.--Cast<br />
 away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have<br />
 transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit.--Lay<br />
 apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive<br />
 with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your<br />
 souls.--Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall<br />
 appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at<br />
 his coming. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every<br />
 one that doeth righteousness is born of him.<br />

                     My sheep hear my voice.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my<br />
 voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup<br />
 with him, and he with me.<br />
<br />
    I sleep, but my heart waketh: [it is] the voice of my beloved<br />
 that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my<br />
 dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, [and] my<br />
 locks with the drops of the night.--I opened to my beloved; but<br />
 my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone: my soul failed<br />
 when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called<br />
 him, but he gave me no answer.<br />
<br />
    Speak; for thy servant heareth.--When Jesus came to the<br />
 place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus,<br />
 make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.<br />
 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.--I<br />
 will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace<br />
 unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again<br />
 to folly.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God;<br />
   and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br />
<br />
    The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy<br />
 Ghost which is given unto us.--Ye have not received the spirit<br />
 of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of<br />
 adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself<br />
 beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of<br />
 God.--He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in<br />
 himself.<br />
<br />
    In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because<br />
 that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we<br />
 might live through him.--In whom we have redemption through his<br />
 blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his<br />
 grace.--That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding<br />
 riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ<br />
 Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one<br />
 another.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                 Reproach hath broken my heart.<br />
<br />
    Is not this the carpenter's son?--Can there any good thing<br />
 come out of Nazareth?--Say we not well that thou art a<br />
 Samaritan, and hast a devil?--He casteth out devils through the<br />
 prince of the devils.--We know that this man is a sinner.--He<br />
 deceiveth the people.--This [man] blasphemeth.--Behold a man<br />
 gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.<br />
<br />
    It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and<br />
 the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the<br />
 house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his<br />
 household?--This [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience<br />
 toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. . . . For even<br />
 hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,<br />
 leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did<br />
 no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was<br />
 reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not;<br />
 but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously.--If ye<br />
 be reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye]; for the<br />
 spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is<br />
 evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Pray every where, lifting up holy hands,<br />
                   without wrath and doubting.<br />
<br />
    The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and<br />
 in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God [is] a<br />
 Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit<br />
 and in truth.--Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer;<br />
 thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I [am].--When ye stand<br />
 praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any.<br />
<br />
    Without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that<br />
 cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a<br />
 rewarder of them that diligently seek him.--Let him ask in<br />
 faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of<br />
 the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man<br />
 think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br />
<br />
    If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear<br />
 [me].--My little children, these things write I unto you, that<br />
 ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the<br />
 Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation<br />
 for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of]<br />
 the whole world.<br />

            My heart panteth, my strength faileth me.<br />

    Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of<br />
 the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:<br />
 lead me to the rock [that] is higher than I.<br />
<br />
    He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my<br />
 strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will<br />
 I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may<br />
 rest upon me. . . . For when I am weak, then am I strong.<br />
<br />
    When [Peter] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and<br />
 beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And<br />
 immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and caught him,<br />
 and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou<br />
 doubt?--[If] thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength<br />
 [is] small.--He giveth power to the faint; and to [them that<br />
 have] no might he increaseth strength.--The eternal God [is thy]<br />
 refuge, and underneath [are] the everlasting arms.--Strengthened<br />
 with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all<br />
 patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.<br />

    It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and<br />
 the servant as his lord.<br />
<br />
    He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and<br />
 acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from<br />
 him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.--In the world ye<br />
 shall have tribulation.--Because ye are not of the world, but I<br />
 have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth<br />
 you.<br />

 but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.--Here have<br />
 we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.<br />
<br />
    Let us run with patience the race that is set before us,<br />
 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who<br />
 for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising<br />
 the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of<br />
 God.<br />

    We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.--<br />
 He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning,<br />

 the head.<br />

 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine<br />
 own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall<br />
 direct thy paths.<br />
<br />
    O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [it<br />
 is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.--Thine ears<br />
 shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This [is] the way, walk<br />
 ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to<br />
 the left.--Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts<br />
 shall be established.--He knoweth the way that I take.--Man's<br />
 goings [are] of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own<br />
 way?<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive<br />
 me [to] glory.--This God [is] our God for ever and ever: he will<br />
 be our guide [even] unto death.<br />

 on [him] the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved<br />
 him to be made like unto [his] brethren.--Upon the likeness of<br />
 the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of a man above<br />
 upon it.--The Son of man which is in heaven.--Behold my hands<br />
 and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a<br />
 spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.<br />
<br />
    [He] made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the<br />
 form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and<br />
 being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became<br />
 obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God<br />
 also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is<br />
 above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should<br />
 bow.--Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that<br />
 are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before<br />
 God.<br />

<br />
               As the Father hath life in himself;<br />
      so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.<br />
<br />
    Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . hath abolished death, and hath<br />
 brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.--I am<br />
 the resurrection, and the life.--Because I live, ye shall live<br />
 also.--We are made partakers of Christ.--Partakers of the Holy<br />
 Ghost.--Partakers of the divine nature.--The first man Adam was<br />
 made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening<br />
 spirit.--Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep,<br />
 but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an<br />
 eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the<br />
 dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br />
<br />
    Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and<br />
 is to come.--Who liveth for ever and ever.--The blessed and only<br />
 Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath<br />
 immortality.--Unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the<br />
 only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              Let us not be desirous of vain glory.<br />
<br />
    Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that<br />
 ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they<br />
 had golden earrings, because they [were] Ishmaelites.) And they<br />
 answered, We will willingly give [them]. And they spread a<br />
 garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his<br />
 prey. . . . And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his<br />
 city, [even] in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring<br />
 after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his<br />
 house.<br />
<br />
    Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek [them] not.--Lest<br />
 I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the<br />
 revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.<br />
<br />
    [Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in<br />
 lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br />
 --Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not;<br />
 charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave<br />
 itself unseemly, seeketh not her own.<br />
<br />
    Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
              Wash me throughly from mine iniquity.<br />
<br />
    I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they<br />
 have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,<br />
 whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed<br />
 against me.--Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye<br />
 shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your<br />
 idols, will I cleanse you.<br />
<br />
    Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot<br />
 enter into the kingdom of God.--If the blood of bulls and of<br />
 goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean,<br />
 sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh. How much more shall<br />
 the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered<br />
 himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead<br />
 works to serve the living God?<br />
<br />
    He saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his<br />
 mighty power to be known.--Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but<br />
 unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth's<br />
 sake.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                    Fellowship in the gospel.<br />
<br />
    As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the<br />
 members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is]<br />
 Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,<br />
 whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free;<br />
 and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<br />
<br />
    God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship<br />
 of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.--That which we have seen and<br />
 heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with<br />
 us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his<br />
 Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have<br />
 fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his<br />
 Son cleanseth us from all sin.--These words spake Jesus, . . .<br />
 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall<br />
 believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as<br />
 thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be<br />
 one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                     Take heed unto thyself.<br />
<br />
    Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all<br />
 things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we<br />
 an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so<br />
 fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my<br />
 body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means,<br />
 when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.--<br />
 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand<br />
 against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh<br />
 and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against<br />
 the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual<br />
 wickedness in high [places].<br />
<br />
    They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the<br />
 affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk<br />
 in the Spirit.--For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,<br />
 they are the sons of God.--Meditate upon these things; give<br />
 thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.<br />

 calleth his own sheep by name. . . . And the sheep follow him:<br />
 for they know his voice.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thy<br />
 walls [are] continually before me.<br />
<br />
    The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The<br />
 Lord knoweth them that are his.--We have a great high priest,<br />
 that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names<br />
 of the children of Israel. . . And Aaron shall bear their names<br />
 before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial. . . . And<br />
 thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment. . . . And thou<br />
 shalt set in it . . . four rows of stones. . . . And the stones<br />
 shall be with the names of the children of Israel, . . . . they<br />
 shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
              My brethren, be strong in the Lord,<br />
                 and in the power of his might.<br />
<br />
    My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made<br />
 perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory<br />
 in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br />
 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in<br />
 necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:<br />
 for when I am weak, then am I strong.--I will go in the strength<br />
 of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness,<br />
 [even] of thine only.--The gospel of Christ . . . is the<br />
 power of God unto salvation.<br />
<br />
    I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.--<br />
 I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh<br />
 in me mightily.--We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that<br />
 the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<br />
<br />
    The joy of the LORD is your strength.--Strengthened with all<br />
 might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and<br />
 longsuffering with joyfulness.<br />

 given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of<br />
 Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things]<br />
 in earth, and [things] under the earth.<br />
<br />
    Messias . . . which is called Christ.--The LORD hath anointed<br />
 me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind<br />
 up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives.<br />
<br />
    The last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit. . . . The first<br />
 man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from<br />
 heaven.--My Lord and my God.--Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye<br />
 say well; for [so] I am. If I then, [your] Lord and Master, have<br />
 washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For<br />
 I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to<br />
 you.<br />

<br />
   The world passeth away, and the lust thereof.--Surely every<br />
 man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain:<br />
 he heapeth up [riches], and knoweth not who shall gather them.--<br />
 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now<br />
 ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.<br />
<br />
    Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many<br />
 things: but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good<br />
 part, which shall not be taken away from her.--I would have you<br />
 without carefulness.<br />
<br />
    These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have<br />
 peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good<br />
 cheer; I have overcome the world.--The Lord of peace himself<br />
 give you peace always by all means.--The LORD bless thee, and<br />
 keep thee: the LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be<br />
 gracious unto thee: the LORD lift up his countenance upon thee,<br />
 and give thee peace.<br />

 that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in<br />

<br />
    We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the<br />
 Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which<br />
 cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what<br />
 [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for<br />
 the saints according to [the will of] God.<br />
<br />
    He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we [are] dust.--A<br />
 bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he<br />
 not quench.<br />
<br />
    The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.<br />

    [Jesus] because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable<br />
 priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the<br />
 uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to<br />
 make intercession for them.--Him that is able to keep you from<br />
 falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of<br />
 his glory.<br />
<br />
    Seeing . . . that we have a great high priest, that is passed<br />
 into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our]<br />
 profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be<br />
 touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all<br />
 points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. Let us<br />
 therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.<br />

 of wrath shalt thou restrain.<br />
<br />
    The eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole<br />

 heart [is] perfect toward him.--We know that all things work<br />

               Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,<br />

<br />
    The love of the Spirit.--The Comforter, [which is] the Holy<br />
 Ghost.--In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel<br />
 of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he<br />
 redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days<br />
 of old. But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore<br />
 he was turned to be their enemy, [and] he fought against them.<br />
<br />
    Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he<br />
 hath given us of his Spirit.--After that ye believed, ye were<br />
 sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of<br />
 our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased<br />
 possession.--[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall<br />
 not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against<br />
 the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are<br />
 contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things<br />
 that ye would.<br />

    The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities.<br />

               I will go [and] return to my place,<br />

    Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and<br />
 your sins have hid [his] face from you.-- My beloved had<br />
 withdrawn himself, [and] was gone: . . . I sought him, but I<br />
 could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.--I<br />
 hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of<br />
 his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him.--Hast thou<br />
 not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the<br />
 LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?<br />
<br />
    He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great<br />
 way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and<br />
 fell on his neck, and kissed him.--I will heal their<br />
 backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned<br />
 away.<br />
<br />
    If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us<br />
 [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br />

 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy<br />
 house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy<br />
 pleasures. For with thee [is] the fountain of life: in thy light<br />
 shall we see light.<br />
<br />
    Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of<br />
 the life that now is, and of that which is to come.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               The Son of God, . . . hath his eyes<br />
                   like unto a flame of fire.<br />
<br />
    The heart [is] deceitful above all [things], and desperately<br />
 wicked: who can know it? I the LORD search the heart, [I] try<br />
 the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, [and]<br />
 according to the fruit of his doings.--Thou hast set our<br />
 iniquities before thee, our secret [sins] in the light of thy<br />
 countenance.--The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter<br />
 remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him,<br />
 Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went<br />
 out, and wept bitterly.<br />
<br />
    Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all<br />
 [men], and needed not that any should testify of man: for he<br />
 knew what was in man.--He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that<br />
 we [are] dust.--A bruised reed shall he not break, and the<br />
 smoking flax shall he not quench.<br />
<br />
    The Lord knoweth them that are his.--I am the good shepherd,<br />
 and know my [sheep], and am known of mine.--My sheep hear my<br />
 voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto<br />
 them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall<br />
 any [man] pluck them out of my hand.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
        Our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep.<br />
<br />
    The chief Shepherd.--I am the good shepherd, and know my<br />
 [sheep], and am known of mine.--My sheep hear my voice, and I<br />
 know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal<br />
 life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck<br />
 them out of my hand.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to<br />
 lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still<br />
 waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of<br />
 righteousness for his name's sake.<br />
<br />
    All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one<br />
 to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us<br />
 all.--I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life<br />
 for the sheep.--I will seek that which was lost, and bring again<br />
 that which was driven away, and will bind up [that which was]<br />
 broken, and will strengthen that which was sick.--Ye were as<br />
 sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and<br />
 Bishop of your souls.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
      The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,<br />
      to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it,<br />
              and the Lamb [is] the light thereof.<br />
<br />
    I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of<br />
 the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with<br />
 me. . . . And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am<br />
 Jesus whom thou persecutest.--Jesus taketh Peter, James, and<br />
 John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain<br />
 apart, and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine<br />
 as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.--The sun<br />
 shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall<br />
 the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee<br />
 an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no<br />
 more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the<br />
 LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy<br />
 mourning shall be ended.<br />
<br />
    The God of all grace, . . . hath called us unto his eternal<br />
 glory by Christ Jesus.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
     The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble;<br />
             and he knoweth them that trust in him.<br />
<br />
    Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD [is] good; for his<br />
 mercy [endureth] for ever.--God [is] our refuge and strength, a<br />
 very present help in trouble.--I will say of the LORD, [He is]<br />
 my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.--Who<br />
 [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of<br />
 thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency!--[As for]<br />
 God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] tried: he<br />
 [is] a buckler to all them that trust in him. For who [is] God,<br />
 save the LORD? and who [is] a rock, save our God?<br />
<br />
    If any man love God, the same is known of him.--The<br />
 foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord<br />
 knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the<br />
 name of Christ depart from iniquity.--The LORD knoweth the way<br />
 of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.--Thou<br />
 hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
              I would have you without carefulness.<br />
<br />
    He careth for you.--The eyes of the LORD run to and fro<br />
 throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf<br />
 of [them] whose heart [is] perfect toward him.<br />
<br />
    O taste and see that the LORD [is] good: blessed [is] the man<br />
 [that] trusteth in him.--The young lions do lack, and suffer<br />
 hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good<br />
 [thing].--Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your<br />
 life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for<br />
 your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat,<br />
 and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they<br />
 sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your<br />
 heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br />
 --Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and<br />
 supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known<br />
 unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,<br />
 shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                    We look for the Saviour.<br />
<br />
    The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all<br />
 men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we<br />
 should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present<br />
 world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing<br />
 of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself<br />
 for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify<br />
 unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.--We,<br />
 according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,<br />
 wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that<br />
 ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him<br />
 in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br />
<br />
    Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto<br />
 them that look for him shall he appear the second time without<br />
 sin unto salvation.--And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this<br />
 [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this<br />
 [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and<br />
 rejoice in his salvation.<br />

 sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with<br />
 patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the<br />
 author and finisher of [our] faith.<br />
<br />
    Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and<br />
 spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br />
<br />
    I press toward the mark.--I . . . so run, not as uncertainly;<br />
 I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that<br />
 by any means, . . . I myself should be a castaway.<br />
<br />
    The fashion of this world passeth away.<br />
<br />
    Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new<br />
 heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.<br />
 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be<br />
 diligent.--Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to<br />
 the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the<br />
 revelation of Jesus Christ.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
       The life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have<br />
       given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement<br />
       for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh<br />
                   an atonement for the soul.<br />
<br />
    Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the<br />
 world.--The blood of the Lamb.--The precious blood of Christ, as<br />
 of a lamb without blemish and without spot.--Without shedding of<br />
 blood is no remission.--The blood of Jesus Christ his Son<br />
 cleanseth us from all sin.<br />
<br />
    By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,<br />
 having obtained eternal redemption [for us].--Having therefore,<br />
 brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of<br />
 Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for<br />
 us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. . . . Let us<br />
 draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.<br />
<br />
    Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your<br />
 body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br />

<br />
                 Oh that I had wings like a dove!<br />
          [for then] would I fly away, and be at rest.<br />
<br />
    It came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God<br />
 prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of<br />
 Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,<br />
 [It is] better for me to die than to live.<br />
<br />
    Job spake, and said, . . . Wherefore is light given to him<br />
 that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul; which<br />
 long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than<br />
 for hid treasures?--Many [are] the afflictions of the righteous:<br />
 but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<br />
<br />
     Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save<br />
 me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.--<br />
 In all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his]<br />
 brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest<br />
 in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the<br />
 sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being<br />
 tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.<br />

    Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and<br />
 broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction: . . . because<br />
 strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth<br />
 unto life, and few there be that find it.--The kingdom of heaven<br />
 suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.--Labour<br />
 not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which<br />
 endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give<br />
 unto you.--Give diligence to make your calling and election<br />
 sure: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly<br />
 into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus<br />
 Christ.--So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth<br />
 for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to<br />
 obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.<br />

 that thou hast heard me.--Father, glorify thy name. Then came<br />
 there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it],<br />
 and will glorify [it] again.--Lo, I come . . . to do thy will, O<br />
 God.--Not my will, but thine, be done.<br />
<br />
    As he is, so are we in this world.--This is the confidence<br />
 that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his<br />
 will, he heareth us.<br />

    Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his<br />
 commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his<br />

<br />
    Without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that<br />
 cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a<br />

    He ever liveth to make intercession for them.--We have an<br />
 advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.<br />

 the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto<br />
 him.--[Abraham] staggered not at the promise of God through<br />
 unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.<br />
<br />
    Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever<br />
 shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast<br />
 into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall<br />
 believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he<br />
 shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What<br />
 things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive<br />
 [them], and ye shall have [them].--If thou canst believe, all<br />
 things [are] possible to him that believeth.--Blessed [is] she<br />

                 Little children, abide in him.<br />

    He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the<br />
 wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall<br />
 receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man [is] unstable<br />
 in all his ways.<br />
<br />
    I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you<br />
 into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not<br />
 another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert<br />
 the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven,<br />
 preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have<br />
 preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br />
<br />
    Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are<br />
 justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.--Ye did run<br />
 well; who did hinder you?<br />
<br />
    As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in<br />
 the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.--If ye abide in<br />
 me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it<br />
 shall be done unto you.--For all the promises of God in him<br />
 [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.<br />

    Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all<br />

 another in love.--Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted,<br />
 forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath<br />
 forgiven you.--The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then<br />
 peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and<br />
 good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.--Charity<br />
 suffereth long, [and] is kind.<br />

                  Emmanuel, . . . God with us.<br />
<br />
    Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?  behold,<br />
 heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. The Word<br />
 was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,<br />
 the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace<br />
 and truth.--Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest<br />
 in the flesh.<br />
<br />
    [God] hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son,<br />
 whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made<br />
 the worlds.<br />
<br />
    The first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where<br />
 the disciples were assembled . . . came Jesus and stood in the<br />
 midst. . . . Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the<br />
 Lord. . . .After eight days again his disciples were within, and<br />
 Thomas with them: [then] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and<br />
 stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you. Then saith he<br />
 to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and<br />
 reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not<br />
 faithless, but believing. And Thomas . . . said unto him, My<br />

     Thus shall ye eat it; [with] your loins girded, . . .<br />
   and ye shall eat it in haste: it [is] the LORD'S passover.<br />
<br />
    Arise ye, and depart; for this [is] not [your] rest.--Here<br />
 have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.--There<br />
 remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.<br />
<br />
    Let your loins be girded about, and [your] lights burning;<br />
 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when<br />
 he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and<br />
 knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. Blessed [are]<br />
 those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find<br />
 watching.--Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to<br />
 the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the<br />
 revelation of Jesus Christ.--[This] one thing [I do], forgetting<br />
 those things which are behind, . . . I press toward the mark for<br />
 the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us<br />
 therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.<br />

 The LORD [is] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.<br />

    Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.--All things are<br />
 yours.--My beloved [is] mine.--The Son of God, . . . loved me,<br />
 and gave himself for me.<br />
<br />
    The LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in<br />
 their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I [am]<br />
 thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.<br />
<br />
    Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon<br />
 earth [that] I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart<br />
 faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my portion<br />
 for ever.<br />
<br />
    Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I<br />
 will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff<br />
 they comfort me.--I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded<br />
 that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him<br />
 against that day.<br />
<br />
    O God, thou [art] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul<br />
 thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and<br />
 thirsty land.<br />

      Watch . . . for ye know neither the day nor the hour<br />
                 wherein the Son of man cometh.<br />
<br />
    Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be<br />
 overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this<br />
 life, and [so] that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare<br />
 shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole<br />
 earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be<br />
 accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to<br />
 pass, and to stand before the Son of man.<br />
<br />
    The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For<br />
 when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction<br />
 cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they<br />
 shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that<br />
 that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children<br />
 of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night,<br />
 nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but<br />
 let us watch and be sober.<br />

<br />
    Not as though I had already attained, either were already<br />
 perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for<br />
 which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count<br />
 not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do],<br />
 forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth<br />
 unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for<br />
 the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for God took him.<br />
<br />
    Grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour<br />
 Jesus Christ.--We all, with open face beholding as in a glass<br />
 the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from<br />
 glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.<br />
<br />
    These words spake Jesus, . . . I pray not that thou shouldest<br />
 take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them<br />
 from the evil. . . . I in them, and thou in me, that they may be<br />
 made perfect in one.<br />

    The house [that is] to be builded for the LORD [must be]<br />
 exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all<br />
 countries.--The glory of the LORD . . . filled the LORD'S house.<br />
<br />
    Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.<br />
 . . . He spake of the temple of his body.--That which was made<br />
 glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory<br />
 that excelleth.--The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,<br />
 (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of<br />
 the Father,) full of grace and truth.--God . . . hath in these<br />
 last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed<br />
 heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.<br />
<br />
    Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will<br />

 of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts<br />

 and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is<br />
 of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the<br />
 righteousness which is of God by faith.--The righteousness of<br />
 God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all<br />
 them that believe: for there is no difference.<br />
<br />
    He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.--I will go<br />
 in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy<br />
 righteousness, [even] of thine only.<br />
<br />
    Ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the<br />
 Lord: walk as children of light.--Have no fellowship with the<br />
 unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them]. . . .<br />
 All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for<br />
 whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith,<br />

 shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly.<br />

<br />
          When ye shall have done all those things which<br />
       are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.<br />
<br />
    Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of<br />
 works? Nay: but by the law of faith.--What hast thou that thou<br />
 didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou<br />
 glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?--By grace are ye<br />
 saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the<br />
 gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are<br />
 his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which<br />
 God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.<br />
<br />
    By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was<br />
 bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more<br />
 abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which<br />
 was with me.--For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all<br />
 things.--All things [come] of thee, and of thine own have we<br />
 given thee.<br />
<br />
    Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight<br />
 shall no man living be justified.<br />

     He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we [are] dust.<br />

    The LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and<br />
 breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a<br />
 living soul.<br />
<br />
    I will praise thee; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully<br />
 made: marvellous [are] thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth<br />
 right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made<br />
 in secret, [and] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the<br />
 earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and<br />
 in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in<br />
 continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of<br />
 them.<br />
<br />
    Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?--In<br />
 him we live, and move, and have our being.--Like as a father<br />
 pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD pitieth them that fear<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    He, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and<br />
 destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,<br />
 and did not stir up all his wrath. For he remembered that they<br />
 [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not<br />
 again.<br />

 because ye were more in number than any people; for ye [were]<br />
 the fewest of all people: but because the LORD loved you.--We<br />
 love him, because he first loved us.--You . . . hath he<br />
 reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present<br />
 you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.<br />
<br />
    Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,<br />
 and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.--God<br />
 commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet<br />
 sinners, Christ died for us.<br />
<br />

 whom I am well pleased.--Therefore doth my Father love me,<br />

 Son, . . . who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the<br />
 express image of his person, and upholding all things by the<br />
 word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat<br />
 down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.<br />

 Lord.<br />
<br />
    I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the<br />
 Father, but by me.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ, . . . hath<br />
 abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light<br />
 through the gospel.<br />
<br />
    The holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the<br />
 first tabernacle was yet standing.--He is our peace, who hath<br />
 made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition<br />
 [between us].--The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the<br />
 top to the bottom.<br />
<br />
    Strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth<br />
 unto life, and few there be that find it.--Thou wilt shew me the<br />
 path of life: in thy presence [is] fulness of joy; at thy right<br />
 hand [there are] pleasures for evermore.<br />

 Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with<br />
 me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though<br />
 he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet<br />
 because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as<br />
 he needeth.--Praying always with all prayer and supplication in<br />
 the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and<br />
 supplication for all saints.<br />
<br />
    I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.--As a prince<br />
 hast thou power with God and with men.--Continue in prayer, and<br />
 watch in the same with thanksgiving.<br />

 we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,<br />
 according to the riches of his grace.--Not by works of<br />
 righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he<br />
 saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the<br />
 Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ<br />
 our Saviour.--Having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out<br />
 the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was<br />
 contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his<br />
 cross.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            The triumphing of the wicked [is] short.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt bruise his heel.--This is your hour, and the power<br />
 of darkness.--As the children are partakers of flesh and blood,<br />
 he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through<br />
 death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is,<br />
 the devil.--Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a<br />
 shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.<br />
<br />
    Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a<br />
 roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom<br />
 resist stedfast in the faith.--Resist the devil, and he will<br />
 flee from you.<br />
<br />
    The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him<br />
 with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that<br />
 his day is coming.--The God of peace shall bruise Satan under<br />
 your feet shortly.--The devil . . . was cast into the lake of<br />
 fire and brimstone, . . . and shall be tormented day and night<br />
 for ever and ever.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
    The younger son . . . took his journey into a far country,<br />
       and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<br />
<br />
    Such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are<br />
 sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,<br />
 and by the Spirit of our God.--We were by nature the children of<br />
 wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his<br />
 great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in<br />
 sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are<br />
 saved;) and hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit<br />
 together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,<br />
 and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.<br />
<br />
    God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet<br />
 sinners, Christ died for us. . . . If, when we were enemies, we<br />
 were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being<br />
 reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
             As Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.<br />
<br />
    There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one<br />
 owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had<br />
 nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.--I forgave thee<br />
 all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not thou<br />
 also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had<br />
 pity on thee?<br />
<br />
    When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:<br />
 that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your<br />
 trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father<br />
 which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.--Put on, . . . as<br />
 the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,<br />
 humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one<br />
 another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel<br />
 against any.<br />
<br />
    How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?<br />
 till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee,<br />
 Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.<br />
<br />
    Charity, . . . is the bond of perfectness.<br />

      He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a<br />
       great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion,<br />
         and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and<br />
 plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide: neither will he<br />
 keep [his anger] for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our<br />
 sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the<br />
 heaven is high above the earth, [so] great is his mercy toward<br />
 them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, [so]<br />
 far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father<br />
 pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD pitieth them that fear<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but<br />
 ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,<br />
 Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that<br />
 we are the children of God.--Ye who sometimes were far off are<br />
 made nigh by the blood of Christ.--Now therefore ye are no more<br />
 strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints,<br />
 and of the household of God.<br />

 --If any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things<br />
 are passed away; behold, all things are become new.<br />
<br />
    A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put<br />
 within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your<br />
 flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.--Purge out<br />
 therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump.--The new<br />
 man, which after God is created in righteousness and true<br />
 holiness.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the<br />
 LORD shall name.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former<br />
 shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.--[Seeing] then<br />
 [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of<br />
 persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and<br />
 godliness?<br />

<br />
      Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make<br />
        [it] go through the fire, and it shall be clean.<br />
<br />
    The LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the<br />
 LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.--He<br />
 shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall<br />
 purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that<br />
 they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.--<br />
 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall<br />
 declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire<br />
 shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<br />
<br />
    I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy<br />
 dross, and take away all thy tin.--I will melt them, and try<br />
 them.<br />
<br />
    Thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is<br />
 tried.--Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went<br />
 through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into<br />
 a wealthy [place].<br />
<br />
    When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee;<br />
 and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
      We, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.<br />

    Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which<br />
 is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in<br />
 the spirit of your mind; and . . . put on the new man, which<br />
 after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.<br />
<br />
    Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.--As<br />
 Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,<br />
 even so we also should walk in newness of life. . . . Knowing<br />
 this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of<br />
 sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.<br />
 For he that is dead is freed from sin.--Likewise reckon ye also<br />
 yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God<br />
 through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in<br />
 your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.<br />
 Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of<br />
 unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as<br />
 those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as]<br />
 instruments of righteousness unto God.<br />

 but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the<br />
 flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and<br />
 gave himself for me.<br />
<br />
    I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good<br />
 thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that<br />
 which is good I find not. . . . O wretched man that I am! who<br />
 shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God<br />
 through Jesus Christ our Lord.--If Christ [be] in you, the body<br />
 [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of<br />
 righteousness.--If ye continue in the faith grounded and<br />
 settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel,<br />
 which ye have heard.<br />
<br />
    Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we<br />
 may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his<br />
 coming.--He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so<br />
 to walk, even as he walked.<br />

 Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light<br />
 which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can<br />
 see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.--I am<br />
 Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,<br />
 which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.<br />

            As the sufferings of Christ abound in us,<br />

    The fellowship of his sufferings.--Rejoice, inasmuch as ye<br />
 are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall<br />
 be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.--If we be<br />
 dead with [him], we shall also live with [him].--If children,<br />
 then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be<br />
 that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified<br />
 together.<br />
<br />
    God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of<br />
 promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an<br />
 oath: that by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible<br />
 for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have<br />
 fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.--Our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath<br />
 loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting consolation and good<br />
 hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in<br />
 every good word and work.<br />

 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not.<br />
 . . .Seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,<br />
 neither be ye of doubtful mind. . . . Your Father knoweth that<br />
 ye have need of these things.<br />
<br />
    Having food and raiment let us be therewith content. . . .<br />
 They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and<br />
 [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in<br />
 destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of<br />
 all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from<br />
 the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.<br />
<br />
    The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and<br />
 the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it<br />
 becometh unfruitful.<br />
<br />
    Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so<br />
 easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is<br />
 set before us.<br />

    The secret of the LORD [is] with them that fear him; and he<br />

 revealeth secrets.--Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how<br />
 little a portion is heard of him?<br />
<br />
    Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth<br />

 therefore will I call upon [him] as long as I live.<br />

 [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much<br />
 speaking.--The Spirit . . . helpeth our infirmities: for we know<br />

    Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, [bless]<br />
 his holy name. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his<br />
 benefits.--I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise<br />
 [shall] continually [be] in my mouth.--Every day will I bless<br />
 thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.<br />
<br />
    Because thy lovingkindness [is] better than life, my lips<br />
 shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will<br />
 lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as<br />
 [with] marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise [thee] with<br />
 joyful lips.<br />
<br />
    My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in<br />
 God my Saviour.<br />
<br />
    Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and<br />
 power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure<br />
 they are and were created.<br />

<br />
        Thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark;<br />
                and there I will meet with thee.<br />
<br />
    The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest.--<br />
 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the<br />
 ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain<br />
 from the top to the bottom.<br />
<br />
    Having . . . brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by<br />
 the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath<br />
 consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.<br />
 . . . Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of<br />
 faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and<br />
 our bodies washed with pure water.--Let us therefore come boldly<br />
 unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find<br />
 grace to help in time of need.<br />
<br />
    Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation<br />
 [mercy seat] through faith in his blood, to declare his<br />
 righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through<br />
 the forbearance of God.--Through him we both have access by one<br />
 Spirit unto the Father.<br />

 but if thou wilt not go with me, [then] I will not go.--God<br />
 subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children<br />
 of Israel.--Gideon . . . feared his father's household, and the<br />
 men of the city, that he could not do [it] by day, . . . did<br />
 [it] by night. Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by<br />
 mine hand, as thou hast said, . . . let me prove, I pray thee.<br />
 . . . And God did so.<br />
<br />
    Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast<br />
 not denied my name.--Who hath despised the day of small things?<br />
<br />
    We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is<br />
 meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly.--Lord,<br />
 increase our faith.--I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall<br />
 grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His<br />
 branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive<br />
 tree, and his smell as Lebanon.<br />

 --There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that<br />

<br />
    Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God [am] holy.--As<br />
 obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the<br />
 former lusts in your ignorance: but as he which hath called you<br />
 is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it<br />
 is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. And if ye call on the<br />
 Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to<br />
 every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning [here] in<br />
 fear.--Put off concerning the former conversation the old man,<br />
 which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be<br />
 renewed in the spirit of your mind; and . . . put on the new<br />
 man, which after God is created in righteousness and true<br />
 holiness.--He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the<br />
 world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in<br />
 love.<br />

 the world to come eternal life.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial<br />
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto<br />
 you.--Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through<br />
 manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much<br />
 more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried<br />
 with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at<br />
 the appearing of Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal<br />
 glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make<br />
 you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].--In the world<br />
 ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome<br />

 shall not lose his reward.--The liberal soul shall be made fat:<br />
 and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.--God [is]<br />
 not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, . . . in<br />
 that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.<br />
<br />
    Every man shall receive his own reward according to his own<br />

    The eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole<br />
 earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of [them] whose heart<br />
 [is] perfect toward him.<br />
<br />
    I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,<br />

 minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.--Whosoever of<br />

<br />
    O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs<br />
 before their enemies! . . . And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get<br />
 thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath<br />
 sinned, . . . for they have even taken of the accursed thing,<br />
 . . . and they have put [it] even among their own stuff.<br />
<br />
    Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot<br />
 save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your<br />
 iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your<br />
 sins have hid [his] face from you, that he will not hear.<br />

    If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear<br />

 --I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br />
 but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the<br />
 flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and<br />
 gave himself for me.--He died for all, that they which live<br />
 should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which<br />
 died for them, and rose again.--If any man [be] in Christ, [he<br />
 is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all<br />
 things are become new.<br />
<br />
    We are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ.--<br />

  prepare a place for you.<br />

     I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I<br />
  am, [there] ye may be also.--Father, I will that they also,<br />
  whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.--Having loved<br />
  his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.<br />
<br />
    We love him, because he first loved us.--The love of Christ<br />
 constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for<br />
 all, then were all dead: and [that] he died for all, that they<br />
 which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto<br />
 him which died for them, and rose again.<br />

    It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away,<br />
 the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will<br />

<br />
           When he shall appear, we shall be like him;<br />
                 for we shall see him as he is.<br />
<br />
    As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the<br />
 sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name.--Whereby<br />
 are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by<br />
 these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped<br />
 the corruption that is in the world through lust.<br />
<br />
    Since the beginning of the world [men] have not heard, nor<br />
 perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside<br />
 thee, [what] he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br />
<br />
    Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:<br />
 now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am<br />
 known.--Christ . . . shall change our vile body, that it may be<br />
 fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working<br />
 whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.--As<br />
 for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be<br />
 satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
       The man [that is] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts.<br />
<br />
    In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.--I<br />
 have laid help upon [one that is] mighty; I have exalted [one]<br />
 chosen out of the people.--I have trodden the winepress alone;<br />
 and of the people [there was] none with me.<br />
<br />
    Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the<br />
 flesh.--Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the<br />
 government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be<br />
 called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting<br />
 Father, The Prince of Peace.<br />
<br />
    The brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his<br />
 person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when<br />
 he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of<br />
 the Majesty on high.--Unto the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O<br />
 God, [is] for ever and ever.<br />
<br />
    Let all the angels of God worship him.<br />
<br />
    KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
          Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, . . .<br />
        and that thou wouldest keep [me] from evil! . . .<br />
          And God granted him that which he requested.<br />
<br />
    The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no<br />
 sorrow with it.--When he giveth quietness, who then can make<br />
 trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him?<br />
<br />
    Salvation [belongeth] unto the LORD: thy blessing [is] upon<br />
 thy people.--How great [is] thy goodness, which thou hast laid<br />
 up for them that fear thee; [which] thou hast wrought for them<br />
 that trust in thee before the sons of men!--I pray not that thou<br />
 shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest<br />
 keep them from the evil.<br />
<br />
    Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;<br />
 knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that<br />
 asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that<br />
 knocketh it shall be opened.--The LORD redeemeth the soul of his<br />
 servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
        It [is] a night to be much observed unto the LORD<br />
          for bringing them out from the land of Egypt.<br />
<br />
    The Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took<br />
 bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said,<br />
 Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in<br />
 remembrance of me. After the same manner also [he took] the cup,<br />
 when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my<br />
 blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of<br />
 me.<br />
<br />
    He . . . kneeled down, and prayed. . . . And being in an<br />
 agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were<br />
 great drops of blood falling down to the ground.<br />
<br />
    It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth<br />
 hour: . . . they took Jesus, and led [him] away; . . . into a<br />
 place called Golgotha: where they crucified him.<br />
<br />
    Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us<br />
 keep the feast.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                   Who shall be able to stand?<br />
<br />
    Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when<br />
 he appeareth? for he [is] like a refiner's fire, and like<br />
 fullers' soap.<br />
<br />
    I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could<br />
 number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,<br />
 stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white<br />
 robes, and palms in their hands.--These are they which came out<br />
 of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them<br />
 white in the blood of the Lamb. . . . They shall hunger no more,<br />
 neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,<br />
 nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne<br />
 shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of<br />
 waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<br />
<br />
    [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in<br />
 Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the<br />
 Spirit.--Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ<br />
 hath made us free.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            Enter not into judgment with thy servant:<br />
       for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.<br />
<br />
    Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though<br />
 your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though<br />
 they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br />
<br />
    Let him take hold of my strength, [that] he may make peace<br />
 with me; [and] he shall make peace with me.--Acquaint now<br />
 thyself with him, and be at peace.<br />
<br />
    Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ.--A man is not justified by the works of the<br />
 law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ.--By the deeds of the law<br />
 there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.<br />
<br />
    By him all that believe are justified from all things, from<br />
 which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.<br />
<br />
    Thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                I know [that] my redeemer liveth.<br />
<br />
    If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the<br />
 death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved<br />
 by his life.--This [man], because he continueth ever, hath an<br />
 unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them<br />
 to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever<br />
 liveth to make intercession for them.<br />
<br />
    Because I live, ye shall live also.--If in this life only we<br />
 have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now<br />
 is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of<br />
 them that slept.<br />
<br />
    The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from<br />
 transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.--We have redemption<br />
 through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the<br />
 riches of his grace.--Ye were not redeemed with corruptible<br />
 things, [as] silver and gold, from your vain conversation<br />
 [received] by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious<br />
 blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                 The Spirit speaketh expressly,<br />
           that in the latter times some shall depart<br />
        from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.<br />
<br />
    Take heed therefore how ye hear.--Let the word of Christ<br />
 dwell in you richly in all wisdom.--Above all, taking the shield<br />
 of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery<br />
 darts of the wicked.<br />
<br />
    Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall<br />
 offend them.--How sweet are thy words unto my taste! [yea,<br />
 sweeter] than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get<br />
 understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br />
<br />
    Thy word [is] a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<br />
 --I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy<br />
 testimonies [are] my meditation.<br />
<br />
    Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.--But<br />
 though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto<br />
 you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be<br />
 accursed.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               His commandments are not grievous.<br />
<br />
    This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which<br />
 seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life.<br />
 --Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his<br />
 commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his<br />
 sight.<br />
<br />
    My yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.--If ye love me,<br />
 keep my commandments.--He that hath my commandments, and keepeth<br />
 them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be<br />
 loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest<br />
 myself to him.<br />
<br />
    Happy [is] the man [that] findeth wisdom, and the man [that]<br />
 getteth understanding.--Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and<br />
 all her paths [are] peace.--Great peace have they which love thy<br />
 law: and nothing shall offend them.--I delight in the law of God<br />
 after the inward man.<br />
<br />
    This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name<br />
 of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.--Love worketh no<br />
 ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the<br />
 law.<br />

 out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember<br />
 thy sins.--Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD:<br />
 though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;<br />
 though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--I will<br />
 remember their sin no more.--Thou wilt cast all their sins into<br />
 the depths of the sea.<br />

    Thou hast in love to my soul [delivered it] from the pit of<br />
 corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.--Who<br />
 [is] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity? . . . he<br />
 retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth [in]<br />
 mercy.--Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in<br />

            As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.<br />
<br />
    My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor<br />
 faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he<br />
 chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.--For whom<br />
 the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son [in<br />
 whom] he delighteth.--He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he<br />
 woundeth, and his hands make whole.--Humble yourselves therefore<br />
 under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.<br />
 --I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.<br />
<br />
    He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.<br />
 --He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us<br />
 according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the<br />
 earth, [so] great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far<br />
 as the east is from the west, [so] far hath he removed our<br />
 transgressions from us. Like as a father pitieth [his] children,<br />
 [so] the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our<br />
 frame; he remembereth that we [are] dust.<br />

<br />

 for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.<br />

 with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men<br />
 [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this<br />
 publican. . . . And the publican, standing afar off, would not<br />
 lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his<br />
 breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this<br />
 man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           The fruit of the Spirit is . . . goodness.<br />
<br />
    Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children.--Love your<br />
 enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate<br />
 you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute<br />
 you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in<br />
 heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the<br />
 good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.--Be ye<br />
 therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.<br />
<br />
    The fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and<br />
 righteousness and truth.<br />
<br />
    After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward<br />
 man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done,<br />
 but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of<br />
 regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; ehich he shed on<br />
 us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.--The LORD [is]<br />
 good to all: and his tender mercies [are] over all his works.--<br />
 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,<br />
 how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<br />

        Ebenezer, . . . Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.<br />

 because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The LORD<br />
 [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I<br />
 am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my<br />
 song will I praise him.<br />
<br />
    [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in<br />
 man. [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence<br />
 in princes.--Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his<br />
 help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God.--He led them forth by<br />
 the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.--<br />
 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had<br />
 spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.<br />
<br />
    When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked<br />
 ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.--Because thou hast been my<br />
 help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.<br />

 serve the tabernacle.--Except a man be born again, he cannot see<br />

 being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from<br />
 the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the<br />

 abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of<br />
 commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself<br />
 of twain one new man, [so] making peace.<br />

 supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was<br />
 able to save him from death.<br />
<br />
    Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know the LORD.--<br />
 Continuing instant in prayer.--Praying always with all prayer<br />
 and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all<br />
 perseverance and supplication.--By prayer and supplication with<br />
 thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the<br />
 peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your<br />
 hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].--This is the<br />
 confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing<br />
 according to his will, he heareth us.<br />

 according to the promise.<br />
<br />
    Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,<br />
 that we should be called the sons of God.--Thou art no more a<br />
 servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through<br />
 Christ.--Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children<br />
 by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of<br />
 his will.<br />
<br />
    Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be<br />
 with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou<br />

 I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame,<br />

           Things which are despised, hath God chosen.<br />
<br />
    Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?<br />
<br />
    Jesus, . . . saw two brethren, . . . casting a net into the<br />
 sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me.--<br />
 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived<br />
 that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and<br />
 they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<br />
<br />
    My speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of<br />
 man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:<br />
 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in<br />
 the power of God.<br />
<br />
    Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained<br />
 you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit.--I am the vine, ye<br />
 [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the<br />
 same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do<br />
 nothing.--We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the<br />
 excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<br />

<br />
                    Leaning on Jesus' bosom.<br />
<br />
    As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.--<br />
 They brought young children to him, that he should touch them:<br />
 and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them].--And he<br />
 took them up in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and blessed<br />
 them.--Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and said, I have<br />
 compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now<br />
 three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them<br />
 away fasting, lest they faint in the way.--An high priest . . .<br />
 touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all<br />
 points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.--In his love<br />
 and in his pity he redeemed them.<br />
<br />
    I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.--Can a<br />
 woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have<br />
 compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet<br />
 will I not forget thee.<br />
<br />
    The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,<br />

 shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<br />

                Jesus Christ the righteous: . . .<br />
                 the propitiation for our sins.<br />
<br />
    Toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.<br />
 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the<br />
 ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. And<br />
 there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from<br />
 above the mercy seat.<br />
<br />
    Surely his salvation [is] nigh them that fear him; . . .<br />
 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have<br />
 kissed [each other].<br />
<br />
    If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall<br />
 stand? But [there is] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be<br />
 feared.--Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD [there<br />
 is] mercy, and with him [is] plenteous redemption. And he shall<br />
 redeem Israel from all his iniquities.--All have sinned, and<br />
 come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his<br />
 grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God<br />
 hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his<br />
 blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
     We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.<br />
<br />
    God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he<br />
 loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us<br />
 together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised<br />
 [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly<br />
 [places] in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew<br />
 the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us<br />
 through Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,<br />
 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have<br />
 everlasting life.--He that spared not his own Son, but delivered<br />
 him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us<br />
 all things?--The LORD [is] good to all: and his tender mercies<br />
 [are] over all his works.<br />
<br />
    We love him, because he first loved us.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [is] she that believed: for there shall be a<br />
 performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
   Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.<br />
<br />
    My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br />
 [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.--Hath not God<br />
 chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the<br />
 kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?<br />
<br />
    Let no man seek his own, but every man another's [wealth].--<br />
 Having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they<br />
 that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into]<br />
 many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction<br />
 and perdition.<br />
<br />
    God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound<br />
 the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to<br />
 confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the<br />
 world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea],<br />
 and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:<br />
 that no flesh should glory in his presence.<br />
<br />
    LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
             Let your speech [be] alway with grace.<br />
<br />
    A word fitly spoken [is like] apples of gold in pictures of<br />
 silver. [As] an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br />
 [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.--Let no corrupt<br />
 communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good<br />
 to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the<br />
 hearers.--A good man out of the good treasure of the heart<br />
 bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil<br />
 treasure bringeth forth evil things.--By thy words thou shalt be<br />
 justified.--The tongue of the wise [is] health.<br />
<br />
    Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another:<br />
 and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance<br />
 was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that<br />
 thought upon his name.<br />
<br />
    If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be<br />
 as my mouth.--Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in]<br />
 faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence,<br />
 . . . [see] that ye abound in this grace also.<br />

<br />
            Thy lovingkindness [is] before mine eyes.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] gracious, and full of compassion; slow to<br />
 anger, and of great mercy.--That ye may be the children of your<br />
 Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the<br />
 evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the<br />
 unjust.<br />
<br />
    Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk<br />
 in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself<br />
 for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling<br />
 savour.--Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one<br />
 another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--<br />
 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through<br />
 the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye]<br />
 love one another with a pure heart fervently.--The love of<br />
 Christ constraineth us.<br />
<br />
    But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for<br />
 nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be<br />
 the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful<br />
 and [to] the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also<br />
 is merciful.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
          Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the<br />
             wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<br />
<br />
    In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and<br />
 supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was<br />
 able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;<br />
 though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things<br />
 which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author<br />
 of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.--We have not<br />
 an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our<br />
 infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet]<br />
 without sin.<br />
<br />
    There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to<br />
 man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be<br />
 tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation<br />
 also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].--<br />
 My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect<br />
 in weakness.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
         The Son of man came not to be ministered unto,<br />
     but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.<br />
<br />
    If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an<br />
 heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of<br />
 the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through<br />
 the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge<br />
 your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<br />
<br />
    He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.--I lay down my life<br />
 for the sheep.--No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of<br />
 myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it<br />
 again.<br />
<br />
    The life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it<br />
 to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for<br />
 it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul.--<br />
 Without shedding of blood is no remission.<br />
<br />
    While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more<br />
 then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from<br />
 wrath through him.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us<br />
      [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br />
<br />
    I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before<br />
 me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil<br />
 in thy sight.<br />
<br />
    And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a<br />
 great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran,<br />
 and fell on his neck, and kissed him.--I have blotted out, as a<br />
 thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins:<br />
 return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.--Your sins are<br />
 forgiven you for his name's sake.--God for Christ's sake hath<br />
 forgiven you.--That he might be just, and the justifier of him<br />
 which believeth in Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be<br />
 clean.--They shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.<br />

 not by water only, but by water and blood.<br />

 not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall<br />
 appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And<br />
 every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as<br />
 he is pure.<br />
<br />
    The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.--An<br />
 high priest . . . holy, harmless, undefiled.<br />
<br />
    We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against<br />
 principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the<br />
 darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high<br />
 [places].--The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that<br />
 now worketh in the children of disobedience.<br />
<br />
    Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten<br />
 of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.<br />
 [And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in<br />
 wickedness.<br />

 that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for<br />
 to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is<br />
 good I find not.<br />

 Christ.--Ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have<br />
 put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the<br />
 image of him that created him.--Not having mine own<br />
 righteousness, which is of the law, but . . . the righteousness<br />
 which is of God by faith.<br />

 robe of righteousness.<br />

 will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make<br />
 manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man<br />
 have praise of God.<br />
<br />
    Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at<br />
 nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment<br />
 seat of Christ.<br />
<br />
    So then every one of us shall give account of himself to<br />
 God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge<br />
 this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to<br />
 fall in [his] brother's way.<br />
<br />
    God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.--The<br />
 Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the<br />
 Son. . . and hath given him authority to execute judgment also,<br />
 because he is the Son of man.<br />
<br />
    The Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, [is] his name,<br />
 great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes [are] open<br />
 upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one<br />
 according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his<br />
 doings.<br />

    Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.<br />
<br />
    It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and<br />
 the servant as his lord.--If they have persecuted me, they will<br />
 also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep<br />
 yours also.--I have given them thy word; and the world hath<br />
 hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not<br />

    Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so<br />

 set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of<br />
 [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the<br />
 cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of<br />

 carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to<br />
 the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in<br />
 the flesh cannot please God.<br />
<br />
    [They] . . . first gave their own selves to the Lord.--In<br />
 every work that [Hezekiah] began . . . to seek his God, he did<br />
 [it] with all his heart, and prospered.<br />
<br />
    Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] the<br />
 issues of life.<br />
<br />
    Whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord.--As the<br />
 servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with<br />
 good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men.<br />
<br />
    I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt<br />
 enlarge my heart.<br />

<br />
                 I [am] with thee to save thee.<br />
<br />
    Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful<br />
 captive delivered? But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of<br />
 the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible<br />
 shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth<br />
 with thee, and I will save thy children. And I will feed them<br />
 that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be<br />
 drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh<br />
 shall know that I the LORD [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,<br />
 the mighty One of Jacob.--Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee:<br />
 be not dismayed; for I [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee;<br />
 yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right<br />
 hand of my righteousness.<br />
<br />
    We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the<br />
 feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like<br />
 as [we are, yet] without sin.--In that he himself hath suffered<br />
 being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.--<br />
 The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he<br />
 delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly<br />
 cast down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.<br />

<br />
    O God, thou [art] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul<br />
 thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and<br />
 thirsty land, where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory.<br />
 --My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the<br />
 LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.--<br />
 Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far<br />
 better.<br />
<br />
    I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.--They<br />
 shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the<br />
 sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the<br />
 midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto<br />
 living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears<br />
 from their eyes.--They shall be abundantly satisfied with the<br />
 fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the<br />
 river of thy pleasures.--My people shall be satisfied with my<br />
 goodness, saith the LORD.<br />

 --Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be<br />
 not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is]<br />
 with thee whithersoever thou goest.--In all thy ways acknowledge<br />
 him, and he shall direct thy paths.<br />
<br />
    He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So<br />
 that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not<br />
 fear what man shall do unto me.--Our sufficiency [is] of God.<br />
<br />
    Lead us not into temptation.--O LORD, I know that the way of<br />
 man [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man that walketh to<br />
 direct his steps.--My times [are] in thy hand.<br />

<br />
             Let us consider one another to provoke<br />
                  unto love and to good works.<br />
<br />
    How forcible are right words!--I stir up your pure minds by<br />
 way of remembrance.<br />
<br />
    They that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the<br />
 LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was<br />
 written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that<br />
 thought upon his name.--If two of you shall agree on earth as<br />
 touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for<br />
 them of my Father which is in heaven.<br />
<br />
    The LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be<br />
 alone.--Two [are] better than one; because they have a good<br />
 reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up<br />
 his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for<br />
 [he hath] not another to help him up.<br />
<br />
    Let . . . no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall<br />
 in [his] brother's way.--Bear ye one another's burdens, and so<br />
 fulfil the law of Christ.--Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a<br />
 fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit<br />
 of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.<br />

    I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able<br />
 to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.--<br />
 I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor<br />
 principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to<br />
 come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be<br />
 able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ<br />
 Jesus our Lord.--Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none<br />
 of them is lost.<br />
<br />
    The LORD taketh pleasure in his people.--My delights [were]<br />
 with the sons of men.--His great love wherewith he loved us.--<br />
 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life<br />
 for his friends.<br />
<br />
    Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your<br />
 body, and in your spirit, which are God's.--Whether we live, we<br />
 live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord:<br />
 whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.<br />

 your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they<br />
 may be as frontlets between your eyes.--This book of the law<br />
 shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate<br />
 therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according<br />
 to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way<br />
 prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.<br />
<br />
    The law of his God [is] in his heart; none of his steps shall<br />
 slide.--By the word of thy lips I have kept [me from] the paths<br />
 of the destroyer.--Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I<br />
 might not sin against thee.<br />
<br />
    We have . . . a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do<br />
 well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark<br />
 place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your<br />
 hearts.--That we through patience and comfort of the scriptures<br />
 might have hope.<br />

 tongue.--The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his<br />
 tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God [is] in his<br />
 heart; none of his steps shall slide.--Let no corrupt<br />
 communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good<br />
 to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the<br />
 hearers.<br />

 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young<br />

    Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for<br />
 the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.--Looking for that blessed<br />

 [which is] our hope.--Whom having not seen, ye love.<br />

 will save us: this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we<br />
 will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.<br />

<br />
    I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the<br />
 will of him that sent me.--I delight to do thy will, O my God:<br />
 yea, thy law [is] within my heart.--O my Father, if this cup may<br />
 not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.<br />
<br />
    Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter<br />
 into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my<br />
 Father which is in heaven.--Not the hearers of the law [are]<br />
 just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.--<br />
 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.--To him<br />
 that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.<br />

    Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the<br />
 renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good,<br />
 and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br />

 whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone<br />
 out into the world.--Judge not according to the appearance, but<br />
 judge righteous judgment.--I speak as to wise men; judge ye what<br />
 I say.--Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all<br />
 wisdom.<br />

 not, and hast found them liars.--Prove all things; hold fast<br />
 that which is good.<br />

 will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not<br />

     Thou [art] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger,<br />

<br />
    I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according<br />

 great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no<br />
 means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the<br />
 fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth<br />
 [generation].<br />
<br />
    O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender<br />
 mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. Help<br />
 us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and<br />
 deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.--O<br />
 LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou [it] for<br />
 thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned<br />
 against thee.--We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the<br />
 iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.<br />

 stand? But [there is] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be<br />
 feared.<br />

<br />
    The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The<br />
 Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth<br />
 the name of Christ depart from iniquity.--Many will say to me in<br />
 that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in<br />
 thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many<br />
 wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew<br />
 you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.--The LORD knoweth<br />
 the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall<br />
 perish.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thy<br />
 walls [are] continually before me.--Set me as a seal upon thine<br />
 heart, as a seal upon thine arm.--The LORD [is] good, a strong<br />
 hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a<br />
 place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;<br />
 that where I am, [there] ye may be also.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                  She hath done what she could.<br />
<br />
    This poor widow hath cast in more than they all.--Whosoever<br />
 shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye<br />
 belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his<br />
 reward.--If there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted<br />
 according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he<br />
 hath not.<br />
<br />
    Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and<br />
 in truth.--If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of<br />
 daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be<br />
 [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those<br />
 things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?--<br />
 But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also<br />
 sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also<br />
 bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,<br />
 [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God<br />
 loveth a cheerful giver.<br />
<br />
    So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things<br />
 which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we<br />
 have done that which was our duty to do.<br />

 neither [are there any works] like unto thy works.--Who shall<br />
 not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for [thou] only<br />
 [art] holy.--Hallowed be thy name.<br />

 mighty to save.--I have laid help upon [one that is] mighty; I<br />
 have exalted [one] chosen out of the people.<br />

 Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as<br />
 Lebanon.<br />
<br />
    My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as<br />
 the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the<br />
 showers upon the grass.--As the rain cometh down, and the snow<br />
 from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth,<br />
 and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the<br />
 sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that goeth<br />
 forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it<br />
 shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper [in<br />
 the thing] whereto I sent it.<br />
<br />
    God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].--And of his<br />

    Such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless,<br />

 harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a<br />
 crooked and perverse nation.<br />
<br />
    Jesus of Nazareth . . . who went about doing good, and<br />
 healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with<br />
 him.--As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all<br />
 [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.<br />

 not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the<br />
 Holy Ghost.--Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves<br />
 in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making<br />
 melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all<br />
 things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus<br />
 Christ.<br />
<br />
    By him . . . let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God<br />
 continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to<br />
 his name.<br />

 rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.--<br />
 Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.--We glory in tribulations also.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
             What profit [is there] of circumcision?<br />
<br />
    Much every way.--Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take<br />
 away the foreskins of your heart.--If then their uncircumcised<br />
 hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of<br />
 their iniquity: then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and<br />
 also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham<br />
 will I remember.<br />
<br />
    Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth<br />
 of God, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers.--In<br />
 whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without<br />
 hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the<br />
 circumcision of Christ.--You, being dead in your sins and the<br />
 uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with<br />
 him, having forgiven you all trespasses.<br />
<br />
    Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which<br />
 is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in<br />
 the spirit of your mind; and . . . put on the new man, which<br />
 after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            The veil of the temple was rent in twain<br />
                   from the top to the bottom.<br />
<br />
    The Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took<br />
 bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said,<br />
 Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in<br />
 remembrance of me.--The bread that I will give is my flesh,<br />
 which I will give for the life of the world.<br />
<br />
    Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his<br />
 blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and<br />
 drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at<br />
 the last day. . . . He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my<br />
 blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath<br />
 sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he<br />
 shall live by me. . . . When Jesus knew in himself that his<br />
 disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend<br />
 you? [What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where<br />
 he was before? It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh<br />
 profiteth nothing.<br />
<br />
    A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,<br />
 through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. . . .Let us draw<br />
 near.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
             In that he died, he died unto sin once:<br />
           but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br />
<br />
    He was numbered with the transgressors.--Christ was once<br />
 offered to bear the sins of many.--Who his own self bare our<br />
 sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,<br />
 should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.<br />
 --By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are<br />
 sanctified.<br />
<br />
    This [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable<br />
 priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the<br />
 uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to<br />
 make intercession for them.--While we were yet sinners, Christ<br />
 died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood,<br />
 we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br />
<br />
    Forasmuch . . . as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,<br />
 arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath<br />
 suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer<br />
 should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of<br />
 men, but to the will of God.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               Keep yourselves in the love of God.<br />

    Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of<br />
 itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye<br />
 abide in me. I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that<br />
 abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:<br />
 for without me ye can do nothing.<br />
<br />
    The fruit of the Spirit is love.<br />
<br />
    Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so<br />
 shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I<br />
 loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments,<br />
 ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's<br />
 commandments, and abide in his love.--Whoso keepeth his word, in<br />
 him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we<br />
 are in him.<br />
<br />
    This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have<br />
 loved you.--God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we<br />
 were yet sinners, Christ died for us.--God is love; and he that<br />
 dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br />

 angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.<br />
 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.<br />
 --And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.--The Lord is<br />
 not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness;<br />
 but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should<br />
 perish, but that all should come to repentance.--The coming of<br />
 the Lord draweth nigh. . . . The judge standeth before the door.<br />

   The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and<br />
 watch unto prayer.--Let your loins be girded about, and [your]<br />
 lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for<br />
 their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he<br />
 cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.<br />

 faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.<br />
 . . . Pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual<br />
 fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias was a man<br />
 subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that<br />
 it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space<br />
 of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the<br />
 heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.<br />
<br />
    Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the<br />
 Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and<br />
 supplication for all saints;<br />
<br />
    Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.--<br />
 Always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand<br />
 perfect and complete in all the will of God.<br />

 make supplication to my judge.--The LORD gave, and the LORD hath<br />
 taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.--What? shall we<br />
 receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?<br />
<br />
    Jesus wept.--A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.--<br />
 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.<br />
<br />
    Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son<br />
 whom he receiveth.--Now no chastening for the present seemeth to<br />
 be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the<br />
 peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised<br />
 thereby.--Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious<br />
 power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.--In<br />

 have overcome the world.<br />

    He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief.<br />

 mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and<br />
 shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those<br />
 things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have<br />
 whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things<br />
 soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive [them],<br />
 and ye shall have [them].--Without faith [it is] impossible to<br />
 please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,<br />
 and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.<br />

    He that had received the promises offered up his only<br />
 begotten [son], of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy<br />
 seed be called: accounting that God [was] able to raise [him]<br />
 up, even from the dead.--Being fully persuaded that, what he had<br />

 life, and the way of death.--I will teach you the good and the<br />
 right way.--I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh<br />
 unto the Father, but by me.--Follow me.<br />

 which go in thereat: because strait [is] the gate, and narrow<br />
 [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that<br />
 find it.<br />
<br />
    An highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called<br />
 The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it<br />
 [shall be] for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not<br />
 err [therein].--Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know<br />
 the LORD.<br />
<br />
    In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were] not<br />
 [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br />

<br />
      By faith Abraham, . . . called to go out into a place<br />
    which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed.<br />
<br />
    He shall choose our inheritance for us.--He led him about, he<br />
 instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle<br />
 stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth<br />
 abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: [so]<br />
 the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange god with<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    I [am] the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which<br />
 leadeth thee by the way [that] thou shouldest go.--Who teacheth<br />
 like him?<br />
<br />
    We walk by faith, not by sight.--Here have we no continuing<br />
 city, but we seek one to come.--Dearly beloved, I beseech [you]<br />
 as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war<br />
 against the soul.--Arise ye, and depart; for this [is] not<br />
 [your] rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you],<br />
 even with a sore destruction.<br />

<br />
         Give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.<br />
<br />
    The heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more<br />
 abominable and filthy [is] man, which drinketh iniquity like<br />
 water?--Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. How much less<br />
 man, [that is] a worm?<br />
<br />
    Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is]<br />
 like thee, glorious in holiness.--Holy, holy, holy, [is] the<br />
 LORD of hosts.<br />
<br />
    As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all<br />
 manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I<br />
 am holy.--Partakers of his holiness.<br />
<br />
    The temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.--What<br />
 manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation<br />
 and godliness, . . . without spot, and blameless.<br />
<br />
    Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but<br />
 that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister<br />
 grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God,<br />
 whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.<br />

                Christ, who is the image of God.<br />
<br />
    The glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall<br />
 see [it] together.--No man hath seen God at any time; the only<br />
 begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath<br />
 declared [him].--And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among<br />
 us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten<br />
 of the Father,) full of grace and truth.--He that hath seen me<br />
 hath seen the Father.--The brightness of [his] glory, and the<br />
 express image of his person.--God was manifest in the flesh.<br />
<br />
    In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the<br />
 forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the<br />
 firstborn of every creature.--Whom he did foreknow, he also did<br />
 predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he<br />
 might be the firstborn among many brethren.<br />
<br />
    And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also<br />
 bear the image of the heavenly.<br />

<br />
       Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle.<br />
<br />
    When I am weak, then am I strong.<br />
<br />
    Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is]<br />
 nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that<br />
 have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and<br />
 in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou [art] our<br />
 God; let not man prevail against thee.--Jehoshaphat cried out,<br />
 and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in<br />
 man. [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence<br />
 in princes.--There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:<br />
 a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An horse [is] a<br />
 vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver [any] by his<br />
 great strength.<br />
<br />
    We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against<br />
 principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the<br />
 darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high<br />
 [places]. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                          Walk in love.<br />
<br />
    A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;<br />
 as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.--Above all<br />
 things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall<br />
 cover the multitude of sins.--Love covereth all sins.<br />
<br />
    When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:<br />
 that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your<br />
 trespasses.--Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping<br />
 for nothing again.--Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and<br />
 let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.--Not rendering<br />
 evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise<br />
 blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should<br />
 inherit a blessing.--If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,<br />
 live peaceably with all men.--Be ye kind one to another,<br />
 tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's<br />
 sake hath forgiven you.<br />
<br />
    My little children, let us not love in word, neither in<br />
 tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
            Let your requests be made known unto God.<br />
<br />
    Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto thee; take away<br />
 this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou<br />
 wilt.--There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger<br />
 of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<br />
 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart<br />
 from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee:<br />
 for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly<br />
 therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.<br />
<br />
    I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my<br />
 trouble.--Hannah . . . [was] in bitterness of soul, and prayed<br />
 unto the LORD, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O<br />
 LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of<br />
 thine handmaid, . . . and wilt give unto thine handmaid a man<br />
 child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his<br />
 life. . . . The LORD remembered her.<br />
<br />
    We know not what we should pray for as we ought.--He shall<br />
 choose our inheritance for us.<br />

             Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens,<br />
                  that thou wouldest come down.<br />
<br />
    Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a<br />
 young hart upon the mountains of spices.--We ourselves groan<br />
 within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the<br />
 redemption of our body.--Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down:<br />
 touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.<br />
<br />
    This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,<br />
 shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.<br />
 --Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time<br />
 without sin unto salvation.--It shall be said in that day, Lo,<br />
 this [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us:<br />
 this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and<br />
 rejoice in his salvation.<br />
<br />
    He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come<br />
 quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.--That blessed hope,<br />
 . . . the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour<br />
 Jesus Christ.--Our conversation is in heaven.<br />

<br />
    No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and<br />
 every tongue [that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou<br />
 shalt condemn. This [is] the heritage of the servants of the<br />
 LORD, and their righteousness [is] of me, saith the LORD.--The<br />
 angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and<br />
 delivereth them. O taste and see that the LORD [is] good:<br />
 blessed [is] the man [that] trusteth in him. O fear the LORD, ye<br />
 his saints: for [there is] no want to them that fear him. The<br />
 young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the<br />
 LORD shall not want any good [thing].--The lines are fallen unto<br />
 me in pleasant [places]; yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br />
<br />
    Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness<br />
 arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow<br />
 up as calves of the stall.--He that spared not his own Son, but<br />
 delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also<br />
 freely give us all things?<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />

               Seek those things which are above,<br />
         where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<br />
<br />
    Get wisdom, get understanding.--The wisdom that is from<br />
 above.--The depth saith, It [is] not in me: and the sea saith,<br />
 [It is] not with me.--We are buried with him by baptism into<br />
 death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the<br />
 glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of<br />
 life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of<br />
 his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his]<br />
 resurrection.<br />
<br />
    Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so<br />
 easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is<br />
 set before us.--God . . . hath quickened us together with<br />
 Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised [us] up<br />
 together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in<br />
 Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a<br />
 country.--Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have<br />
 wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness.<br />

<br />
         Nicodemus . . . he that came to Jesus by night.<br />
<br />
    Peter followed him afar off.--Among the chief rulers also<br />
 many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not<br />
 confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for<br />
 they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.--The<br />
 fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the<br />
 LORD shall be safe.<br />
<br />
    Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--A bruised<br />
 reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not<br />
 quench.--Faith as a grain of mustard seed.<br />
<br />
    God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and<br />
 of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of<br />
 the testimony of our Lord.--Little children, abide in him; that,<br />
 when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed<br />
 before him at his coming.--Whosoever . . . shall confess me<br />
 before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in<br />
 heaven.<br />

 leader and commander to the people.--It became him, for whom<br />
 [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many<br />
 sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect<br />
 through sufferings.--We must through much tribulation enter into<br />
 the kingdom of God.<br />
<br />
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against<br />
 principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the<br />
 darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high<br />

 do not war after the flesh: 4  (For the weapons of our warfare<br />

 you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].<br />

 have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are<br />
 no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the<br />
 saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the<br />

 being the chief corner [stone]; in whom all the building fitly<br />
 framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom<br />
 ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through<br />
 the Spirit.<br />

 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God.--Without faith [it is]<br />
 impossible to please [him].--He that believeth on him is not<br />
 condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already,<br />
 because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten<br />
 Son of God.--Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.<br />
<br />
    Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God<br />
 perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.--Faith which<br />
 worketh by love.--Faith without works is dead?<br />
<br />
    We walk by faith, not by sight.--I am crucified with Christ:<br />
 nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the<br />
 life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the<br />
 Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.--Whom having<br />
 not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see [him] not, yet<br />
 believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:<br />
 receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your]<br />
 souls.<br />

<br />
         The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.<br />
<br />
    Like as a father pitieth [his] children, [so] the LORD<br />
 pitieth them that fear him.--The LORD [is] gracious and full of<br />
 compassion. He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will<br />
 ever be mindful of his covenant.<br />
<br />
    He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that<br />
 keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.--As an eagle<br />
 stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth<br />
 abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: [So]<br />
 the LORD alone did lead him, and [there was] no strange god with<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    His compassions fail not. [They are] new every morning: great<br />
 [is] thy faithfulness.<br />
<br />
    Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved<br />
 with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.--The same<br />

    The very hairs of your head are all numbered. . . . Are not<br />

 own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before<br />
 the world began.<br />
<br />
    We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of<br />
 sins.<br />
<br />
    Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,<br />
 arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath<br />
 suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer<br />
 should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of<br />
 men, but to the will of God.<br />

    Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is]<br />
 like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing<br />
 wonders?--He saw that [there was] no man, and wondered that<br />
 [there was] no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation<br />
 unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.--Who his own<br />
 self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.--Being made a<br />
 curse for us.<br />
<br />
    O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous<br />
 things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the<br />
 victory.--Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a<br />
 shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.--He shall see<br />
 of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his<br />
 knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall<br />
 bear their iniquities.<br />
<br />
    O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.--We are more than<br />
 conquerors through him that loved us.--They overcame . . . by<br />
 the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.<br />

              His mercy [is] on them that fear him.<br />
<br />
    [Oh] how great [is] thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for<br />
 them that fear thee; [which] thou hast wrought for them that<br />
 trust in thee before the sons of men! Thou shalt hide them in<br />
 the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt<br />
 keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.<br />
<br />
    If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons<br />
 judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your<br />
 sojourning [here] in fear.--The LORD [is] nigh unto all them<br />
 that call upon him, . . . in truth. He will fulfil the desire of<br />
 them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save<br />
 them.<br />
<br />
    Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself<br />
 before the LORD, . . . and hast rent thy clothes, and wept<br />
 before me; I also have heard [thee], saith the LORD.--To this<br />
 [man] will I look, [even] to [him that is] poor and of a<br />
 contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.--The LORD [is] nigh<br />
 unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a<br />
 contrite spirit.<br />

 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not<br />
 worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he<br />
 that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.<br />

          and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.<br />
<br />
    Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith.--I have<br />
 glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou<br />
 gavest me to do.--We are sanctified through the offering of the<br />
 body of Jesus Christ once [for all]. And every priest standeth<br />
 daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,<br />
 which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had<br />
 offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right<br />
 hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made<br />
 his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever<br />
 them that are sanctified.--Blotting out the handwriting of<br />
 ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and<br />
 took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.<br />
<br />
    Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,<br />
 that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay<br />
 it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power<br />
 to take it again.--Greater love hath no man than this, that a<br />
 man lay down his life for his friends.<br />

 and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course<br />
 of this world. . . . We all had our conversation in times past<br />
 in the lusts of our flesh.<br />
<br />
    Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of<br />
 the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed.--<br />
 Out of the belly of hell cried I, [and] thou heardest my voice.<br />
 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;<br />
 and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves<br />
 passed over me.--We went through fire and through water: but<br />
 thou broughtest us out into a wealthy [place].<br />

    When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee;<br />
 and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.<br />

                    Walk in newness of life.<br />

    As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and<br />
 to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members<br />
 servants to righteousness unto holiness.--I beseech you, . . .<br />
 brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a<br />
 living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your<br />
 reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be<br />
 ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.<br />
<br />
    If any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things<br />
 are passed away; behold, all things are become new.--In Christ<br />
 Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor<br />
 uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk<br />
 according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy.--This I<br />
 say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk<br />
 not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind.--But ye<br />
 have not so learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, and<br />
 have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus.--Put on the<br />
 new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true<br />
 holiness.<br />

 is] not in man that walketh to direct his steps.--Not as I will,<br />
 but as thou [wilt].--Surely I have behaved and quieted myself,<br />
 as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul [is] even as a<br />
 weaned child.<br />
<br />
    We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the<br />
 Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which<br />
 cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what<br />
 [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for<br />
 the saints according to [the will of] God.<br />
<br />
    Ye know not what ye ask.--He gave them their request; but<br />
 sent leanness into their soul.--These things were our examples,<br />
 to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also<br />
 lusted.<br />
<br />
    I would have you without carefulness.--Thou wilt keep [him]<br />

 trusteth in thee.<br />

 me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither [is<br />

 not of evil, to give you an expected end.--My thoughts [are] not<br />
 your thoughts, neither [are] your ways my ways, saith the LORD.<br />

    I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and<br />

 the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.--Now no chastening for the<br />
 present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless<br />
 afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto<br />
 them which are exercised thereby.--Humble yourselves therefore<br />
 under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.<br />

 thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.<br />

 much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge<br />
 increaseth sorrow.--I made me great works; I builded me houses;<br />
 I planted me vineyards. . . I gathered me also silver and gold.<br />
 . . . Then I looked on all, . . . and, behold, all [was] vanity<br />
 and vexation of spirit.<br />
<br />
    If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.--He<br />
 satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with<br />
 goodness.<br />
<br />
    Set your affection on things above, not on things on the<br />
 earth.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
    I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,<br />
        but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.<br />
<br />
    Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in<br />
 the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine<br />
 as lights in the world.--Ye are the salt of the earth . . . the<br />
 light of the world.--Let your light so shine before men, that<br />
 they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is<br />
 in heaven.<br />
<br />
    I also withheld thee from sinning against me.<br />
<br />
    The Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you]<br />
 from evil.--So did not I, because of the fear of God.--Who gave<br />
 himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present<br />
 evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.--Now<br />
 unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present<br />
 [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding<br />
 joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty,<br />
 dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
       Whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.<br />
<br />
    The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high.--The LORD [is]<br />
 high above all nations, [and] his glory above the heavens. . . .<br />
 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth the needy<br />
 out of the dunghill; that he may set [him] with princes.<br />
<br />
    God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he<br />
 loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us<br />
 together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised<br />
 [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly<br />
 [places] in Christ Jesus.<br />
<br />
    He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us<br />
 all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<br />
 . . . For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor<br />
 angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor<br />
 things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,<br />
 shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in<br />
 Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />

<br />
             That through death he might destroy him<br />
                  that had the power of death.<br />
<br />
    Our Saviour Jesus Christ, . . . hath abolished death, and<br />
 hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.--<br />
 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe<br />
 away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people<br />
 shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath<br />
 spoken [it].--When this corruptible shall have put on<br />
 incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,<br />
 then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death<br />
 is swallowed up in victory. O death, where [is] thy sting? O<br />
 grave, where [is] thy victory? The sting of death [is] sin; and<br />
 the strength of sin [is] the law. But thanks [be] to God, which<br />
 giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and<br />
 of love, and of a sound mind.--Yea, though I walk through the<br />
 valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou<br />
 [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
           Where [is] the way [where] light dwelleth?<br />
<br />
    God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.--As long as I<br />
 am in the world, I am the light of the world.<br />
<br />
    If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in<br />
 darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the<br />
 light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with<br />
 another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from<br />
 all sin. The Father . . . hath made us meet to be partakers of<br />
 the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us<br />
 from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the<br />
 kingdom of his dear Son: in whom we have redemption through his<br />
 blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins.<br />
<br />
    Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the<br />
 day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.--Ye are the light<br />
 of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. . . .<br />
 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good<br />
 works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<br />

            For the Lord will not cast off for ever:<br />
     but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion.<br />
<br />
    Fear thou not, . . . saith the LORD: for I [am] with thee;<br />
 . . . I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in<br />
 measure.--For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with<br />
 great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my<br />
 face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will<br />
 I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. . . . For the<br />
 mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my<br />
 kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant<br />
 of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.<br />
 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, [and] not comforted,<br />
 behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy<br />
 foundations with sapphires.<br />
<br />
    I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have<br />
 sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute<br />
 judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I<br />
 shall behold his righteousness.<br />

    When the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD<br />
 raised them up a deliverer, Ehud, . . . a man lefthanded. . . .<br />
 After him was Shamgar . . . . which slew of the Philistines six<br />
 hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.<br />
<br />
    The LORD looked upon [Gideon], and said, Go in this thy<br />
 might: . . . have not I sent thee? And he said unto him, Oh my<br />
 Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family [is] poor<br />
 in Manasseh, and I [am] the least in my father's house.<br />
<br />
    And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that [are] with<br />
 thee [are] too many for me, . . . lest Israel vaunt themselves<br />
 against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.<br />
<br />
    Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD<br />
 of hosts.--My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power<br />
 of his might.<br />

    If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and<br />
 receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be<br />
 also.--An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that<br />
 fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.--Here have we no<br />
 continuing city, but we seek one to come.<br />
<br />
    This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,<br />
 shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.<br />
 --Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.<br />
 Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the<br />
 earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early<br />
 and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for<br />
 the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.--Yet a little while, and he<br />
 that shall come will come, and will not tarry.<br />
<br />
    We which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together<br />

 shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another<br />
 with these words.<br />

 adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with<br />
 mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,<br />
 nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such<br />
 were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but<br />
 ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the<br />
 Spirit of our God.<br />

 times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of<br />
 the flesh and of the mind.<br />

 salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH<br />
 [is] my strength and [my] song; he also is become my salvation.<br />
 --The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in<br />
 him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and<br />
 with my song will I praise him.--My soul shall be joyful in my<br />
 God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he<br />
 hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom<br />
 decketh [himself] with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth<br />

 hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly<br />

 blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the<br />
 adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to<br />
 the good pleasure of his will.<br />

 love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.<br />

 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: not of works, lest any man<br />

 no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<br />
<br />

 pleasure.--Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that<br />
 ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect,<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
          Pray one for another, that ye may be healed.<br />
<br />
    Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me<br />
 to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes:<br />
 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt<br />
 thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I<br />
 find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it].<br />
<br />
    Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.--Pray<br />
 for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.<br />
<br />
    I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which<br />
 thou hast given me; for they are thine.--Neither pray I for<br />
 these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through<br />
 their word.--Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the<br />
 law of Christ.<br />
<br />
    The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth<br />
 much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he<br />

    Surely the people [is] grass. The grass withereth, the flower<br />
 fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.--The world<br />
 passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will<br />
 of God abideth for ever.<br />
 2 Corinthians 6:2<br />
<br />
    Behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day<br />
 of salvation.--Use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the<br />
 fashion of this world passeth away.--Let us consider one another<br />
 to provoke unto love and to good works: not forsaking the<br />
 assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is];<br />
 but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the<br />
 day approaching.<br />

<br />
     What God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do<br />
       according to thy works, and according to thy might?<br />
<br />
    Who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? [who] among<br />
 the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? . . . O<br />
 LORD God of hosts, who [is] a strong LORD like unto thee?  or to<br />
 thy faithfulness round about thee?--Among the gods [there is]<br />
 none like unto thee, O Lord; neither [are there any works] like<br />
 unto thy works.--For thy word's sake, and according to thine own<br />
 heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy<br />
 servant know [them]. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for<br />
 [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside<br />
 thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br />
<br />
    Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into<br />
 the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them<br />
 that love him. But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his<br />
 Spirit.--The secret [things belong] unto the LORD our God: but<br />
 those [things which are] revealed [belong] unto us and to our<br />
 children.<br />

          He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br />

 mighty [man] glory in his might, let not the rich [man] glory in<br />
 his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he<br />
 understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] the LORD.<br />
<br />
    I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the<br />
 knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the<br />
 loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win<br />
 Christ.--I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the<br />
 power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.--I have<br />
 . . . whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things<br />
 which pertain to God.<br />
<br />
    Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon<br />
 earth [that] I desire beside thee.--My heart rejoiceth in the<br />
 LORD. . . . I rejoice in thy salvation.<br />
<br />
    Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give<br />
 glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth's sake.<br />

              As he which hath called you is holy,<br />

<br />
    Ye know how we exhorted . . . and charged every one of you,<br />
 . . . that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto<br />
 his kingdom and glory.--Ye should shew forth the praises of him<br />
 who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.<br />
<br />
    Ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the<br />
 Lord: walk as children of light: (for the fruit of the Spirit<br />
 [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) proving what<br />
 is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the<br />
 unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].--Being<br />
 filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus<br />
 Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.<br />
<br />
   Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your<br />
 good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.--Whether<br />
 therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the<br />
 glory of God.<br />

    A new heart . . . will I give you, and a new spirit will I<br />
 put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your<br />
 flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my<br />
 spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. . . .<br />
 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet [for] this be enquired of by<br />
 the house of Israel, to do [it] for them.<br />
<br />
    If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that<br />
 they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is<br />
 in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my<br />
 name, there am I in the midst of them.<br />
<br />
    Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever<br />
 shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast<br />
 into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall<br />
 believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he<br />
 shall have whatsoever he saith.<br />

             God [is] not a man, that he should lie;<br />
         neither the son of man, that he should repent.<br />
<br />
    The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither<br />
 shadow of turning.--Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day,<br />
 and for ever.<br />
<br />
    His truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler.<br />
<br />
    God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of<br />
 promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an<br />
 oath: that by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible<br />
 for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have<br />
 fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.<br />
<br />
    The faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them<br />
 that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand<br />
 generations.--All the paths of the LORD [are] mercy and truth<br />
 unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.--Happy [is<br />
 he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is]<br />
 in the LORD his God: which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and<br />
 all that therein [is]: which keepeth truth for ever.<br />

            [If] thou faint in the day of adversity,<br />
                    thy strength [is] small.<br />
<br />
    He giveth power to the faint; and to [them that have] no<br />
 might he increaseth strength.--My grace is sufficient for thee:<br />
 for my strength is made perfect in weakness.--He shall call upon<br />
 me, and I will answer him: I [will be] with him in trouble; I<br />
 will deliver him, and honour him.--The eternal God [is thy]<br />
 refuge, and underneath [are] the everlasting arms: and he shall<br />
 thrust out the enemy from before thee.<br />
<br />
    I looked [for some] to take pity, but [there was] none; and<br />
 for comforters, but I found none.<br />
<br />
    Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in<br />
 things [pertaining] to God, . . . who can have compassion on the<br />
 ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; . . . so also<br />
 Christ . . . though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by<br />
 the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became<br />
 the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.--<br />
 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.<br />

<br />
    All things are yours. . . . and ye are Christ's; and Christ<br />
 [is] God's.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . gave himself for us.<br />
 [God] gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the<br />
 church.--Christ . . . loved the church, and gave himself for<br />
 it; . . . that he might present it to himself a glorious church,<br />
 not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it<br />
 should be holy and without blemish.<br />
<br />
    My soul shall make her boast in the LORD.--I will greatly<br />
 rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he<br />
 hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered<br />
 me with the robe of righteousness.<br />
<br />
    Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? and [there is] none upon<br />
 earth [that] I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart<br />
 faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my portion<br />
 for ever.--[O my soul], thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou [art]<br />
 my Lord: my goodness [extendeth] not to thee.--The LORD [is] the<br />
 portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my<br />
 lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant [places]; yea, I<br />
 have a goodly heritage.<br />

 after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve<br />
 them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or<br />
 that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to<br />
 know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and<br />
 with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and<br />
 fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye<br />
 shall serve him, and cleave unto him.<br />

 shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.<br />

 we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are<br />
 the Lord's.--Let no man seek his own, but every man another's<br />
 [wealth].--Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in<br />
 your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br />
<br />
    Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by<br />
 life, or by death. For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die<br />
 [is] gain. But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my<br />
 labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. For I am in a strait<br />
 betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ;<br />
 which is far better.<br />
<br />
    I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto<br />
 God. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,<br />
 but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the<br />
 flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and<br />
 gave himself for me.<br />

 Peace.<br />
<br />
    Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure<br />
 for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth<br />
 his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ<br />
 died for us.--Who, being in the form of God, thought it not<br />
 robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation,<br />
 and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the<br />
 likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled<br />
 himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the<br />
 cross.--The love of Christ . . . passeth knowledge.<br />
<br />
    Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.--In whom are<br />
 hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.--The unsearchable<br />
 riches of Christ.--Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is<br />
 made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and<br />
 redemption.<br />

 beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen<br />
 you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief<br />
 of the truth: Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the<br />
 obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.--[God] hath<br />
 saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to<br />
 our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was<br />
 given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.--Thine eyes did<br />
 see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all [my<br />
 members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned,<br />
 when [as yet there was] none of them.<br />
<br />

 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have<br />
 everlasting life.<br />

    Thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that<br />
 formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I<br />
 have called [thee] by thy name; thou [art] mine. When thou<br />
 passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through<br />
 the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.--[Even] to [your] old<br />
 age I [am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs will I carry [you].<br />
<br />
<br />
    As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,<br />
 spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her<br />
 wings: [so] the LORD alone did lead him.--He bare them, and<br />
 carried them all the days of old.<br />
<br />
    Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.--<br />
 For I am persuaded, that neither . . . height, nor depth, nor<br />
 any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love<br />
 of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />

    Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not<br />
 have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,<br />
 yet will I not forget thee.<br />

                      I know their sorrows.<br />
<br />
    A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.--Touched with<br />
 the feeling of our infirmities.<br />
<br />
    Himself took our infirmities, and bare [our] sicknesses.--<br />
 Jesus, . . . being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the<br />
 well.<br />
<br />
   When Jesus . . . saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping<br />
 which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.<br />
 . . . Jesus wept.--For in that he himself hath suffered being<br />
 tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.<br />
<br />
    He hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from<br />
 heaven did the LORD behold the earth; to hear the groaning of<br />
 the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death.--He<br />
 knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall<br />
 come forth as gold.--When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,<br />
 then thou knewest my path.<br />
<br />
    He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.--In all<br />
 their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence<br />
 saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he<br />
 bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<br />

 the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.--He that watereth<br />
 shall be watered also himself.<br />
<br />
    My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish<br />
 his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then]<br />
 cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and<br />
 look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And<br />
 he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life<br />
 eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may<br />
 rejoice together.--The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man<br />

    He brought me up . . . out of an horrible pit, out of the<br />
 miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, [and] established my<br />
 goings. And he hath put a new song in my mouth, [even] praise<br />
 unto our God.<br />
<br />
    When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died<br />
 for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die:<br />
 yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But<br />
 God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet<br />
 sinners, Christ died for us.--God, who is rich in mercy, for his<br />
 great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in<br />
 sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.<br />

               I will greatly rejoice in the LORD,<br />

<br />
    I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise [shall]<br />
 continually [be] in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in<br />
 the LORD: the humble shall hear [thereof], and be glad. O<br />
 magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.--<br />
 The LORD will give grace and glory: no good [thing] will he<br />
 withhold from them that walk uprightly. O LORD of hosts, blessed<br />
 [is] the man that trusteth in thee.--Bless the LORD, O my soul:<br />
 and all that is within me, [bless] his holy name.<br />
<br />
   Is any merry? let him sing psalms.--Be filled with the Spirit;<br />
 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,<br />
 singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving<br />
 thanks always for all things.--Singing with grace in your hearts<br />
 to the Lord.<br />
<br />
    At midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God:<br />
 and the prisoners heard them.--Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and]<br />
 again I say, Rejoice.<br />

<br />
    Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.--God [is]<br />
 a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit<br />
 and in truth.--But we are all as an unclean [thing], and all our<br />
 righteousnesses [are] as filthy rags.--I will be sanctified in<br />
 them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be<br />
 glorified.<br />
<br />
    This [is] the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain<br />
 the whole limit thereof round about [shall be] most holy.--<br />
 Holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.<br />
<br />
    For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be<br />
 sanctified through the truth.--Seeing . . . that we have a great<br />
 high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of<br />
 God, let us . . . come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we<br />
 may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br />

 [there is] no want to them that fear him. The young lions do<br />
 lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not<br />
 want any good [thing].--His compassions fail not. [They are] new<br />
 every morning: great [is] thy faithfulness.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:<br />
 thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in<br />
 pleasant [places]; yea, I have a goodly heritage.--Whether . . .<br />
 the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to<br />
 come; all are yours.--Blessed [be] the God and Father of our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual<br />
 blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ.<br />

     By the word of thy lips I have kept [me from] the paths of<br />
 the destroyer. Hold up my goings in thy paths, [that] my<br />

 thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it<br />
 shall talk with thee. For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the<br />
 law [is] light.--Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee,<br />
 saying, This [is] the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the<br />
 right hand, and when ye turn to the left.<br />
<br />
    I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not<br />
 walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.--We have<br />
 also a . . . sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye<br />
 take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.--Now we<br />
 see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know<br />
 in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.--They<br />
 need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God<br />
 giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.<br />

 God; arise therefore.<br />

            The accuser of our brethren is cast down,<br />

<br />
<br />
    They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word<br />
 of their testimony.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of<br />
 God's elect? [It is] God that justifieth. Who [is] he that<br />
 condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen<br />
 again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh<br />
 intercession for us.<br />
<br />
    Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of<br />
 them openly, triumphing over them in it.--That through death he<br />
 might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the<br />
 devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their<br />
 lifetime subject to bondage.--In all these things we are more<br />
 than conquerors through him that loved us.--Put on the whole<br />
 armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of<br />
 the devil. . . . And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword<br />
 of the Spirit, which is the word of God.--But thanks [be] to<br />
 God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />

 raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son<br />
 quickeneth whom he will. . . . As the Father hath life in<br />
 himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.<br />

    To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of<br />
 life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.--In the<br />
 midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [was<br />
 there] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner of] fruits,<br />
 [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree<br />

 that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they<br />
 relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.<br />
<br />
    God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in<br />
 trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be<br />
 removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of<br />
 the sea.--[It is] better to trust in the LORD than to put<br />
 confidence in man. [It is] better to trust in the LORD than to<br />
 put confidence in princes.--The steps of a [good] man are<br />
 ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. Though he<br />
 fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth<br />
 [him with] his hand.<br />

     O taste and see that the LORD [is] good: blessed [is] the<br />

    Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night. . . .He<br />
 shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt<br />
 thou trust.--Even as a hen gathereth her chickens under [her]<br />
 wings.--He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth<br />
 thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall<br />
 neither slumber nor sleep. The LORD [is] thy keeper: the LORD<br />

 be afraid.<br />

 boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in<br />
 this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth<br />
 out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made<br />
 perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us.<br />
<br />
    Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of<br />
 faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and<br />

 If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the<br />

 life of the world.--My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is<br />
 drink indeed.<br />

     The free gift [is] of many offences unto justification.<br />
<br />
    Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as<br />
 snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--<br />
 I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for<br />
 mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put me in<br />
 remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou<br />
 mayest be justified.--I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy<br />
 transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I<br />
 have redeemed thee.<br />
<br />
    God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,<br />
 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have<br />
 everlasting life.--Not as the offence, so also [is] the free<br />
 gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more<br />
 the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man,<br />
 Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.--And such were some of<br />
 you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are<br />
 justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of<br />
 our God.<br />

 not itself, is not puffed up.<br />
<br />
    Follow after . . . meekness.--Take my yoke upon you, and<br />

 oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he<br />
 is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her<br />

 who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; . . . but committed<br />
 [himself] to him that judgeth righteously.<br />

 or [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.<br />
 Yet if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;<br />
 but let him glorify God on this behalf.<br />
<br />
    Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to<br />
 believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.--If one died<br />
 for all, then were all dead: And [that] he died for all, that<br />
 they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but<br />
 unto him which died for them, and rose again.--If we suffer, we<br />
 shall also reign with [him].<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
             Wait on the LORD: be of good courage,<br />
              and he shall strengthen thine heart.<br />
<br />
    Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, [that] the<br />
 everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth,<br />
 fainteth not, neither is weary? . . . He giveth power to the<br />
 faint; and to [them that have] no might he increaseth strength.<br />
 --Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; for I<br />
 [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee;<br />
 yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br />
 --Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy<br />
 in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the<br />
 heat, when the blast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm<br />
 [against] the wall.<br />
<br />
    The trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience<br />
 have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,<br />
 wanting nothing.--Cast not away therefore your confidence, which<br />
 hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience,<br />
 that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the<br />
 promise.<br />

    The wicked [are] like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest.<br />
 . . . [There is] no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.<br />
<br />
    Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I<br />
 will give you rest.--Rest in the LORD.--He that is entered into<br />
 his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works.<br />
<br />
    Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For<br />
 [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace.--<br />
 That we . . . be no more children, tossed to and fro, and<br />
 carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of<br />
 men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to<br />
 deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in<br />
 all things, which is the head, [even] Christ.<br />
<br />
    I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit<br />
 [was] sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house,<br />
 and his banner over me [was] love.<br />

<br />
               Neither shall there be leaven seen<br />
                 with thee in all thy quarters.<br />
<br />
    The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil.--Abhor that which is<br />
 evil.--Abstain from all appearance of evil.--Looking diligently<br />
 lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of<br />
 bitterness springing up trouble [you], and thereby many be<br />
 defiled.<br />
<br />
    If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear<br />
 [me].<br />
<br />
    Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?<br />
 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,<br />
 as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed<br />
 for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven,<br />
 neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the<br />
 unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.--Let a man examine<br />
 himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that]<br />
 cup.<br />
<br />
    Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from<br />
 iniquity.--Such an high priest became us, [who is] holy,<br />
 harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.--In him is no sin.<br />

<br />
    I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve<br />
 through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the<br />
 simplicity that is in Christ.<br />
<br />
    My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his<br />
 might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to<br />
 stand against the wiles of the devil.--Take unto you the whole<br />
 armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,<br />
 and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your<br />
 loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of<br />
 righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the<br />
 gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith,<br />
 wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the<br />
 wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the<br />
 Spirit, which is the word of God.--Lest Satan should get an<br />
 advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.<br />

 Be still, and know that I [am] God.--Said I not unto thee, that,<br />
 if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?--<br />
 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of<br />
 men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in<br />
 that day.<br />
<br />
    Mary, . . . sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.--Mary<br />
 hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from<br />
 her.--In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and<br />
 in confidence shall be your strength.--Commune with your own<br />
 heart upon your bed, and be still.<br />
<br />
    Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not<br />
 thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the<br />
 man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br />

    He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,<br />

                What I do thou knowest not now;<br />

<br />
    Thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led<br />
 thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and]<br />
 to prove thee, to know what [was] in thine heart, whether thou<br />
 wouldest keep his commandments, or no.<br />
<br />
    When I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time<br />
 [was] the time of love; . . . yea, I sware unto thee, and<br />
 entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou<br />
 becamest mine.--Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial<br />
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto<br />
 you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's<br />
 sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be<br />
 glad also with exceeding joy.--Our light affliction, which is<br />
 but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and]<br />
 eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which<br />
 are seen, but at the things which are not seen.<br />

    He is the head of the body, the church.--The head over all<br />
 [things] to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him<br />
 that filleth all in all.--We are members of his body, of his<br />
 flesh, and of his bones.<br />
<br />
    A body hast thou prepared me.--Thine eyes did see my<br />
 substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all [my members]<br />
 were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as<br />
 yet there was] none of them.<br />
<br />
    Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.--He hath chosen us<br />
 in him before the foundation of the world.--Whom he did<br />
 foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the<br />
 image of his Son.<br />
<br />
    Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even]<br />
 Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and<br />
 compacted by that which every joint supplieth, . . . maketh<br />
 increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.<br />

 children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.<br />
 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy<br />
 house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy<br />
 pleasures. For with thee [is] the fountain of life.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but<br />
 ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye<br />
 shall be thirsty.--Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall<br />
 give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him<br />
 shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting<br />
 life.--This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on<br />
 him should receive.<br />
<br />
    Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.--The<br />
 Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say,<br />
 Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let<br />
 him take the water of life freely.<br />

 after thee, as a thirsty land. . . . Hide not thy face from me,<br />
 lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. Cause me to<br />

 cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my<br />
 soul unto thee.<br />

                  Watchman, what of the night?<br />

    [It is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our<br />
 salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent,<br />
 the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of<br />
 darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.<br />
<br />
    Learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet<br />
 tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh:<br />
 so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it<br />
 is near, [even] at the doors.--Heaven and earth shall pass away,<br />
 but my words shall not pass away.<br />
<br />
   I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I<br />
 hope. My soul [waiteth] for the Lord more than they that watch<br />
 for the morning: [I say, more than] they that watch for the<br />
 morning.<br />
<br />
    He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come<br />
 quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Watch, . . . for ye know neither the day nor the hour<br />
 wherein the Son of man cometh.<br />

    How precious . . . are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great<br />
 is the sum of them! [If] I should count them, they are more in<br />
 number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.--O<br />
 LORD, how great are thy works! [and] thy thoughts are very deep.<br />
 --Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou<br />
 hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward.<br />

 weighed.--That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination<br />
 in the sight of God.--[The LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man<br />
 looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the<br />
 heart.--Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man<br />
 soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh<br />
 shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the<br />
 Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.<br />

 faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of<br />
 Israel will not forsake them.--I [am] the LORD thy God, . . .<br />
 open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br />
<br />
    Wherefore do ye spend money for [that which is] not bread?<br />
 and your labour for [that which] satisfieth not? hearken<br />
 diligently unto me, and eat ye [that which is] good, and let<br />
 your soul delight itself in fatness.--I am the bread of life: he<br />
 that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on<br />
 me shall never thirst.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
    My feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br />
<br />
    When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.<br />
<br />
    The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired [to<br />
 have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat: but I have prayed<br />
 for thee, that thy faith fail not.<br />
<br />
    A just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again.--<br />
 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD<br />
 upholdeth [him with] his hand.<br />
<br />
    Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall<br />
 arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD [shall be] a light unto<br />
 me.--He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there<br />
 shall no evil touch thee.<br />
<br />
    If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus<br />
 Christ the righteous.--Wherefore he is able also to save them to<br />
 the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth<br />
 to make intercession for them.<br />

            I will give them one heart, and one way,<br />
      that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them.<br />
<br />
    A new heart . . . will I give you, and a new spirit will I<br />
 put within you.--Good and upright [is] the LORD: therefore will<br />
 he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment:<br />
 and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the LORD<br />
 [are] mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his<br />
 testimonies.<br />
<br />
    That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I<br />

 believe that thou hast sent me.<br />
<br />
    I . . . beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation<br />
 wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, . . .<br />
 endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of<br />
 peace. [There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are<br />
 called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one<br />
 baptism, one God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and<br />
 through all, and in you all.<br />

 may rest upon me.--Let him take hold of my strength.<br />
<br />
    Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee.--<br />
 The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the<br />
 mighty [God] of Jacob.<br />
<br />
    I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.<br />
<br />
    Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a<br />
 shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the<br />
 God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.--Plead [my<br />

 them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and<br />
 stand up for mine help.<br />

    Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil.<br />
<br />
    Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with<br />
 God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the<br />
 enemy of God.<br />
<br />
    What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and<br />
 what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath<br />
 Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an<br />

 Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world.<br />
 If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<br />
 . . . The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that<br />
 doeth the will of God abideth for ever.<br />

    In time past ye walked according to the course of this world,<br />
 according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that<br />
 now worketh in the children of disobedience.--Ye have not so<br />
 learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, . . . as the<br />

 compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted [with]<br />
 all my ways.--Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our<br />
 secret [sins] in the light of thy countenance.--All things [are]<br />
 naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.<br />
<br />
    Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though<br />
 your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though<br />
 they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--He is gracious<br />
 unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I<br />
 have found a ransom.--He [was] wounded for our transgressions,<br />
 [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our<br />
 peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.--He<br />
 hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.--Thy faith hath made<br />
 thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.<br />

 are risen, and stand upright.<br />

 are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to<br />
 escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].<br />

 that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water<br />
 of life freely.--Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall<br />

 Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,<br />
 he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your<br />

 know that we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were<br />

 In me ye . . . have peace. In the world ye shall have<br />
 tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.<br />

 wipe away tears from off all faces.--There shall be no more<br />
 death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any<br />
 more pain: for the former things are passed away.--We which are<br />
 alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the<br />
 clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be<br />
 with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
               A bruised reed shall he not break.<br />
<br />
    The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a<br />
 contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.--He healeth the<br />
 broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.--For thus saith<br />
 the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name [is]<br />
 Holy; I dwell in the high and holy [place], with him also [that<br />
 is] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the<br />
 humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will<br />
 not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the<br />
 spirit should fail before me, and the souls [which] I have made.<br />
<br />
    I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which<br />
 was driven away, and will bind up [that which was] broken, and<br />
 will strengthen that which was sick.--Wherefore lift up the<br />
 hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight<br />
 paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of<br />
 the way; but let it rather be healed.--Behold, your God . . .<br />
 will come and save you.<br />

            O taste and see that the LORD [is] good:<br />

    When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was<br />

 Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when<br />
 men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast<br />
 kept the good wine until now.<br />
<br />
    For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.--I<br />
 believed, and therefore have I spoken.--I know whom I have<br />
 believed.--I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and<br />
 his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.<br />
<br />
    The goodness of God.--He that spared not his own Son, but<br />
 delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also<br />
 freely give us all things?<br />
<br />
    As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that<br />
 ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord [is]<br />

 mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.<br />
 --I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou<br />
 hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast<br />
 revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good<br />
 in thy sight.--We have received, not the spirit of the world,<br />
 but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things<br />
 that are freely given to us of God.--How precious also are thy<br />
 thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! [If] I<br />
 should count them, they are more in number than the sand.--O the<br />
 depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how<br />
 unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<br />
 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his<br />

 you; seek, and ye shall find.<br />

 received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<br />

 redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth [to<br />
 be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his<br />
 righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through<br />
 the forbearance of God.--Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<br />

 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God.--Grace, mercy, [and] peace,<br />
 from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.--Unto every one<br />
 of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of<br />
 Christ.--As every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister<br />
 the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace<br />
 of God.--He giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth<br />
 the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br />

 Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and for ever. Amen.<br />

 that he have mercy upon us.--Because thou hast been my help,<br />

 against this great company that cometh against us; neither know<br />
 we what to do: but our eyes [are] upon thee.--Mine eyes [are]<br />

 earth.<br />

 the rich [man] glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth<br />
 glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am]<br />

 of wisdom and knowledge.--Counsel [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I<br />
 [am] understanding; I have strength.<br />

 poverty might be rich.--Of his fulness have all we received, and<br />
 grace for grace.--My God shall supply all your need according to<br />
 his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.--God [is] able to make all<br />
 grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency<br />
 in all [things], may abound to every good work.<br />
<br />
    Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and<br />
 heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love<br />
 him?--Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not<br />
 many noble, [are called]: but God hath chosen the foolish things<br />
 of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak<br />
 things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.<br />

    All things are yours; whether . . . the world, or life, or<br />
 death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and<br />
 ye are Christ's; and Christ [is] God's.--All things [are] for<br />
 your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the<br />
 thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. For which<br />
 cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the<br />
 inward [man] is renewed day by day. For our light affliction,<br />
 which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding<br />
 [and] eternal weight of glory.<br />

 worketh patience. But let patience have [her] perfect work, that<br />
 ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br />

 shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall<br />

    Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save<br />
 me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.<br />
<br />
    I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the<br />
 will of him that sent me.--He . . . became obedient unto death,<br />
 even the death of the cross.--In the days of his flesh, when he<br />
 had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and<br />
 tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was<br />
 heard in that he feared; Though he were a Son, yet learned he<br />
 obedience by the things which he suffered.<br />
<br />
    Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he<br />
 shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?--<br />
 Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to<br />
 rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and<br />
 remission of sins should be preached in his name among all<br />
 nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<br />

    Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial<br />
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto<br />
 you.--If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with<br />
 sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if<br />
 ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are<br />
 ye bastards, and not sons.<br />
<br />
    The LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the<br />
 LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.<br />
<br />
    The LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's<br />
 sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.--<br />
 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have<br />
 compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet<br />
 will I not forget thee.--Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of<br />
 Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God.<br />
<br />
    Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night<br />
 unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will<br />
 avenge them speedily.<br />

    All things are yours; . . . the world, or life, or death, or<br />

 goodness of thy house, [even] of thy holy temple.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] good unto them that wait for him, to the soul<br />
 [that] seeketh him.--Therefore will the LORD wait, that he may<br />
 be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he<br />
 may have mercy upon you: for the LORD [is] a God of judgment:<br />
 blessed [are] all they that wait for him.<br />
<br />
    Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the<br />
 holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he<br />
 hath consecrated for us; . . . let us draw near with a true<br />
 heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled<br />
 from an evil conscience.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
           Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld<br />
 his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)<br />
 full of grace and truth.--Thou art fairer than the children of<br />
 men: grace is poured into thy lips.--All bare him witness, and<br />
 wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
   Ye have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.--He that believeth<br />
 on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.--We speak that we<br />
 do know, and testify that we have seen.<br />
<br />
    O taste and see that the LORD [is] good: blessed [is] the man<br />
 [that] trusteth in him.--I sat down under his shadow with great<br />
 delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.<br />
<br />
    He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my<br />
 strength is made perfect in weakness.--Unto every one of us is<br />
 given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.--As<br />
 every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister the same<br />
 one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
              Let patience have [her] perfect work,<br />
       that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br />
<br />
    Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through<br />
 manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much<br />
 more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried<br />
 with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at<br />
 the appearing of Jesus Christ.--We glory in tribulations also:<br />
 knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,<br />
 experience; and experience, hope.<br />
<br />
    [It is] good that [a man] should both hope and quietly wait<br />
 for the salvation of the LORD.--Ye have in heaven a better and<br />
 an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence,<br />
 which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of<br />
 patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might<br />
 receive the promise.--Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God,<br />
 even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given [us]<br />
 everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort<br />
 your hearts.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
       God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.<br />

    Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both<br />
 will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make<br />
 manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man<br />
 have praise of God.--The Father judgeth no man, but hath<br />
 committed all judgment unto the Son: . . . because he is the Son<br />
 of man.--The Son of God, . . . hath his eyes like unto a flame<br />
 of fire.<br />
<br />
    They say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the<br />
 most High?--These [things] hast thou done, and I kept silence;<br />
 thou thoughtest that I was altogether [such an one] as thyself:<br />
 [but] I will reprove thee, and set [them] in order before thine<br />
 eyes.--There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;<br />
 neither hid, that shall not be known.<br />
<br />
    Lord, all my desire [is] before thee; and my groaning is not<br />
 hid from thee.--Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins<br />
 and my heart.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
 A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right [is] he.<br />
<br />
    Him that judgeth righteously.--We must all appear before the<br />
 judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things<br />
 [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether<br />
 [it be] good or bad.--Every one of us shall give account of<br />
 himself to God.--The soul that sinneth, it shall die.<br />
<br />
    Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man<br />
 [that is] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the<br />
 shepherd.--The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.--<br />
 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have<br />
 kissed [each other].--Mercy rejoiceth against judgment.--The<br />
 wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life<br />
 through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />
<br />
    A just God and a Saviour; [there is] none beside me.--Just,<br />
 and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.--Justified<br />
 freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ<br />
 Jesus.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                Death is swallowed up in victory.<br />
<br />
    Thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and<br />
 blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that<br />
 through death he might destroy him that had the power of death,<br />
 that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death<br />
 were all their lifetime subject to bondage.<br />
<br />
    If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live<br />
 with him: knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth<br />
 no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he<br />
 died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth<br />
 unto God.<br />
<br />
    Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto<br />
 sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />
<br />
    In all these things we are more than conquerors through him<br />
 that loved us.<br />

    Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,<br />

<br />
    Every one [that is] proud in heart [is] an abomination to the<br />
 LORD: [though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not be unpunished.<br />
<br />
    O LORD, thou [art] our father; we [are] the clay, and thou<br />
 our potter; and we all [are] the work of thy hand. Be not wroth<br />
 very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold,<br />
 see, we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people.--Thou hast<br />
 chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed [to<br />
 the yoke]: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou [art]<br />
 the LORD my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and<br />
 after that I was instructed, I smote upon [my] thigh: I was<br />
 ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach<br />
 of my youth.--[It is] good for a man that he bear the yoke in<br />
 his youth.<br />
<br />
    Affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble<br />
 spring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the<br />
 sparks fly upward.<br />

                       Yea, hath God said?<br />
<br />
    When the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son<br />
 of God.--[Jesus] said, It is written, . . . it is written, . . .<br />
 it is written.--Then the devil leaveth him.<br />
<br />
    I may not return with thee. . . . For it was said to me by<br />
 the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water<br />
 there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. He<br />
 said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an angel<br />
 spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back<br />
 with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink<br />
 water. [But] he lied unto him. So he went back with him. . . .<br />
 The man of God, . . . was disobedient unto the word of the LORD:<br />
 therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath<br />
 torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD.--<br />
 Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto<br />
 you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be<br />
 accursed.--Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not<br />
 sin against thee.<br />

    O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion<br />
 over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.--<br />
 We are [thine]: thou never barest rule over them; they were not<br />
 called by thy name.<br />
<br />
    All people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the<br />
 name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.--The LORD<br />
 will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because<br />
 it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.<br />
<br />
    O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer<br />
 not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people<br />
 are called by thy name.--Help us, O God of our salvation, for<br />
 the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins,<br />
 for thy name's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where<br />
 [is] their God?<br />

 runneth into it, and is safe.<br />

 night sheweth knowledge. [There is] no speech nor language,<br />
 [where] their voice is not heard.<br />
<br />
    When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the<br />
 moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that<br />
 thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest<br />
 him?<br />

 from [another] star in glory. So also [is] the resurrection of<br />

    The love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.--Greater love<br />
 hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his<br />
 friends.--Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,<br />
 though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye<br />
 through his poverty might be rich.--Beloved, if God so loved us,<br />
 we ought also to love one another.--Be ye kind one to another,<br />
 tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's<br />
 sake hath forgiven you.--Forbearing one another, and forgiving<br />
 one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as<br />
 Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.--For even the Son of man<br />
 came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his<br />
 life a ransom for many.--Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving<br />
 us an example, that ye should follow his steps.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           The fruit of the Spirit is . . . temperance.<br />
<br />
    Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all<br />
 things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we<br />
 an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so<br />
 fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my<br />
 body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means,<br />
 when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br />
<br />
    Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with<br />
 the Spirit.<br />
<br />
    If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and<br />
 take up his cross, and follow me.<br />
<br />
    Let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be<br />
 sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be<br />
 drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the<br />
 day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and<br />
 for an helmet, the hope of salvation.--Denying ungodliness and<br />
 worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,<br />
 in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the<br />
 glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus<br />
 Christ.<br />

    First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in<br />
 the ear.--Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the<br />
 knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the<br />
 measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<br />
<br />
    They measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing<br />
 themselves among themselves, are not wise. . . . But he that<br />
 glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth<br />
 himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.<br />
<br />
    The body [is] of Christ. Let no man beguile you of your<br />
 reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,<br />
 intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly<br />

                  The goat shall bear upon him<br />
         all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited:<br />
         and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.<br />
<br />
    As far as the east is from the west, [so] far hath he removed<br />
 our transgressions from us.--In those days, and in that time,<br />
 saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and<br />
 [there shall be] none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not<br />
 be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.--Thou wilt cast<br />
 all their sins into the depths of the sea.--Who [is] a God like<br />
 unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity.<br />
<br />
    All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one<br />
 to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us<br />
 all.--He shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide<br />
 him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil<br />
 with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death:<br />
 and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin<br />
 of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.--The Lamb<br />
 of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.<br />

    By the grace of God I am what I am.--Of his own will begat he<br />
 us with the word of truth.--[It is] not of him that willeth, nor<br />
 of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.--Where [is]<br />
 boasting then? It is excluded.--Christ Jesus . . . is made unto<br />
 us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and<br />
 redemption: . . . He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br />
<br />
     You [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and<br />
 sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of<br />
 this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the<br />
 spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among<br />
 whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts<br />
 of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the<br />

 this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br />
<br />
    Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,<br />
 that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by<br />
 whose stripes ye were healed.--In whom we have redemption<br />
 through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the<br />
 riches of his grace.<br />
<br />
    Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are<br />
 justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of<br />
 our God.--Ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an<br />
 holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the<br />
 praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his<br />
 marvellous light.--I beseech you . . . brethren, by the mercies<br />
 of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,<br />
 acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.<br />

 There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<br />

 over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the<br />

 [was] Shimei the Ramathite. . . . All these [were] the rulers of<br />
 the substance which [was] king David's.<br />
<br />
    God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily<br />
 prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of<br />
 healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.--All these<br />
 worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man<br />
 severally as he will.<br />
<br />
    As every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister the<br />
 same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of<br />
 God. If any man speak, [let him speak] as the oracles of God; if<br />

 giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus<br />
 Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.<br />

<br />
         Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone<br />
                    while he talked with him.<br />
<br />
   Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give<br />
 glory.--Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]? or<br />
 thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?--In lowliness of mind let each<br />
 esteem other better than themselves.--Be clothed with humility.<br />
<br />
    [Jesus] was transfigured before them: and his face did shine<br />
 as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.--All that<br />
 sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as<br />
 it had been the face of an angel.--The glory which thou gavest<br />
 me I have given them.--We all, with open face beholding as in a<br />
 glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image<br />
 from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.<br />
<br />
    Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill<br />
 cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a<br />
 bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that<br />
 are in the house.<br />

              There are diversities of operations,<br />

<br />
    There fell [some] of Manasseh to David. . . . And they helped<br />
 David against the band [of the rovers]: for they [were] all<br />
 mighty men of valour.--The manifestation of the Spirit is given<br />
 to every man to profit withal.<br />
<br />
    Of the children of Issachar, [which were men] that had<br />
 understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do.--To<br />
 one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the<br />
 word of knowledge by the same Spirit.<br />
<br />
    Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with<br />
 all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:<br />
 [they were] not of double heart.--A double minded man [is]<br />
 unstable in all his ways.<br />

    There should be no schism in the body; but . . . the members<br />
 should have the same care one for another. And whether one<br />

 honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<br />

    One Lord, one faith, one baptism.<br />

<br />
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou<br />
 disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise<br />
 him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and my God.--LORD,<br />
 thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare<br />
 their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.--For thou, Lord,<br />
 [art] good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto<br />
 all them that call upon thee.<br />

 me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I<br />
 went.--Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his<br />
 benefits.<br />
<br />
    I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my<br />
 supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,<br />
 therefore will I call upon [him] as long as I live. The sorrows<br />
 of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I<br />
 found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the<br />
 LORD.<br />

 will not tarry.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is]<br />
 with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one<br />
 day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men<br />
 count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing<br />
 that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br />
 --Thou, O Lord, [art] a God full of compassion, and gracious,<br />
 longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.--Oh that thou<br />
 wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down.-- For<br />
 since the beginning of the world [men] have not heard, nor<br />
 perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside<br />
 thee, [what] he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br />

 are impossible with men are possible with God.--He doeth<br />

 inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say<br />
 unto him, What doest thou?--[There is] none that can deliver out<br />
 of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?--Abba, Father,<br />
 all things [are] possible unto thee.<br />
<br />
    Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him,<br />
 Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your<br />
 faith be it unto you.--Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me<br />
 clean. And Jesus put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying,<br />
 I will; be thou clean.--The mighty God.--All power is given unto<br />
 me in heaven and in earth.<br />

    Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses: but we will<br />

 with us than with him.<br />

 to walk humbly with thy God?--To keep the commandments of the<br />
 LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy<br />
 good?<br />
<br />
    As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:<br />
 for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in<br />

 the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to<br />
 the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour<br />
 to men of skill.--A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD<br />
 directeth his steps.<br />
<br />
    Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the<br />
 heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hand of<br />

 we what to do: but our eyes [are] upon thee.<br />

 that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
             The words of the LORD [are] pure words.<br />
<br />
    Thy word [is] very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.--<br />
 The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart: the<br />
 commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.--Every<br />
 word of God [is] pure: he [is] a shield unto them that put their<br />
 trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee,<br />
 and thou be found a liar.<br />
<br />
    Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin<br />
 against thee.--I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect<br />
 unto thy ways.--Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if<br />
 [there be] any praise, think on these things.--As newborn babes,<br />
 desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.<br />
<br />
    We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of<br />
 sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in<br />
 Christ.--Nor handling the word of God deceitfully.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
              The whole family in heaven and earth.<br />
<br />
    One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through<br />
 all, and in you all.--Ye are all the children of God by faith in<br />
 Christ Jesus.--That in the dispensation of the fulness of times<br />
 he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which<br />
 are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him.<br />
<br />
    He is not ashamed to call them brethren.--Behold my mother<br />
 and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father<br />
 which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and<br />
 mother.--Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my<br />
 Father, and your Father.<br />
<br />
    I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for<br />
 the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: . . .<br />
 and white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was<br />
 said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,<br />
 until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should<br />
 be killed as they [were], should be fulfilled.--That they<br />
 without us should not be made perfect.<br />

                After this manner . . . pray ye:<br />

<br />
    Jesus . . . lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father.--<br />
 My Father, and your Father; and [to] my God, and your God.<br />
<br />
    Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.--Ye<br />
 have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye<br />
 have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,<br />
 Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that<br />
 we are the children of God.<br />
<br />
    Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his<br />
 Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art<br />
 no more a servant, but a son.<br />
<br />
    Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the<br />
 Father in my name, he will give [it] you. Hitherto have ye asked<br />
 nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may<br />
 be full.<br />
<br />
    I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye<br />
 shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near.<br />
<br />
    How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt<br />
 thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my<br />
 soul, [having] sorrow in my heart daily?--Hide not thy face<br />
 [far] from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been<br />
 my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my<br />
 salvation.<br />
<br />
    He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I [will be]<br />
 with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.--The<br />
 LORD [is] nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that<br />
 call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that<br />
 fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.<br />
<br />
    I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.--Lo, I<br />
 am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.<br />
<br />
    God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in<br />
 trouble.--Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him [cometh] my<br />
 salvation.--My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation<br />
 [is] from him.<br />

                      Hallowed be thy name.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name<br />
 [is] Jealous, [is] a jealous God.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who [is]<br />
 like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful [in] praises, doing<br />
 wonders?--Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.<br />
<br />
    Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.--I saw . . . the<br />
 Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train<br />
 filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had<br />
 six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he<br />
 covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto<br />
 another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the LORD of hosts: the<br />
 whole earth [is] full of his glory. . . . Woe [is] me! for I am<br />
 undone.--I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now<br />
 mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor [myself].<br />
<br />
    The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all<br />
 sin.--That [we] might be partakers of his holiness.--Having<br />
 therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the<br />
 blood of Jesus, . . . Let us draw near with a true heart.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
     God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,<br />
            not imputing their trespasses unto them.<br />
<br />
    It pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell;<br />
 and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to<br />
 reconcile all things unto himself.--Mercy and truth are met<br />
 together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other].<br />
<br />
    I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,<br />
 thoughts of peace, and not of evil.--Come now, and let us reason<br />
 together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they<br />
 shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they<br />
 shall be as wool.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?<br />
<br />
    Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.--Work out<br />
 your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which<br />
 worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.--<br />
 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought<br />
 all our works in us.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                        Thy kingdom come.<br />

    In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a<br />
 kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall<br />
 not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and<br />
 consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.--A<br />
 stone . . . cut out without hands.--Not by might, nor by power,<br />
 but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.--The kingdom of God<br />
 cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here!<br />
 or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.<br />
<br />
    Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of<br />
 God.--So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed<br />
 into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and<br />
 the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. . . .<br />
 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in<br />
 the sickle, because the harvest is come.<br />
<br />
    Be ye . . . ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the<br />
 Son of man cometh.<br />
<br />
    The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth<br />
 say, Come.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />

       From the first day that thou didst set thine heart<br />
      to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God,<br />
                      thy words were heard.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,<br />
 whose name [is] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy [place], with<br />
 him also [that is] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive<br />
 the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the<br />
 contrite ones.--The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a<br />
 broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.--<br />
 Though the LORD [be] high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:<br />
 but the proud he knoweth afar off.--Humble yourselves therefore<br />
 under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.<br />
 --God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.<br />
 Submit yourselves therefore to God.<br />
<br />
    Thou, Lord, [art] good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous<br />
 in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Give ear, O LORD,<br />
 unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In<br />
 the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt<br />
 answer me.<br />

<br />
        Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven.<br />

<br />
    It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that<br />
 one of these little ones should perish.<br />
<br />
    This is the will of God, [even] your sanctification.--That he<br />
 no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the<br />
 lusts of men, but to the will of God.--Of his own will begat he<br />
 us with the word of truth; . . . wherefore lay apart all<br />
 filthiness.<br />
<br />
    Be ye holy; for I am holy.--[Jesus] said . . . Whosoever<br />
 shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister,<br />
 and mother.--Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth<br />
 them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house<br />
 upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and<br />
 the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for<br />
 it was founded upon a rock.--The world passeth away, and the<br />
 lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for<br />
 ever.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Christ both died, and rose, and revived,<br />
       that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.<br />
<br />
    Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to<br />
 grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he<br />
 shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the<br />
 pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of<br />
 the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his<br />
 knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall<br />
 bear their iniquities.--Ought not Christ to have suffered these<br />
 things, and to enter into his glory?--We thus judge, that if one<br />
 died for all, then were all dead: and [that] he died for all,<br />
 that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,<br />
 but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<br />
<br />
    Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath<br />
 made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and<br />
 Christ.--Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of<br />
 the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by<br />
 him do believe in God.<br />

<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               Give us this day our daily bread.<br />
<br />
    I have been young, and [now] am old; yet have I not seen the<br />
 righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.--[His] bread<br />
 shall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure.--The ravens<br />
 brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh<br />
 in the evening; and he drank of the brook.<br />
<br />
    My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in<br />
 glory by Christ Jesus.--[Be] content with such things as ye<br />
 have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake<br />
 thee.<br />
<br />
    He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee<br />
 with manna, . . . that he might make thee know that man doth not<br />
 live by bread only, but by every [word] that proceedeth out of<br />
 the mouth of the LORD doth man live.--Jesus said unto them,<br />
 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread<br />
 from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from<br />
 heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from<br />
 heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him,<br />
 Lord, evermore give us this bread.<br />

 God of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the<br />
 horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour.<br />
 --The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in<br />
 him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and<br />
 with my song will I praise him.<br />

 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:<br />
 but, Until seventy times seven.--O thou wicked servant, I<br />
 forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest<br />
 not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as<br />
 I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to<br />
 the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. So<br />
 likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from<br />
 your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.<br />
 --Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one<br />
 another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--You<br />
 . . . hath he quickened, . . . having forgiven you all<br />
 trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was<br />
 against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the<br />
 way, nailing it to his cross.--Even as Christ forgave you, so<br />
 also [do] ye.<br />

 garden of the LORD. . . . Then Lot chose him all the plain of<br />
 Jordan; . . . but the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners<br />
 before the LORD exceedingly.<br />
<br />
    [The Lord] delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy<br />
 conversation of the wicked. . . . The Lord knoweth how to<br />
 deliver the godly out of temptations.--Yea, he shall be holden<br />
 up: for God is able to make him stand.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           In thy name shall they rejoice all the day:<br />
         and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.<br />
<br />
    In the LORD have I righteousness and strength: [even] to him<br />
 shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall be<br />
 ashamed. In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified,<br />
 and shall glory.--Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye<br />
 righteous: and shout for joy, all [ye that are] upright in<br />
 heart.<br />
<br />
    The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being<br />
 witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of<br />
 God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all<br />
 them that believe.--To declare . . . at this time his<br />
 righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him<br />
 which believeth in Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.--Whom<br />
 having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see [him] not,<br />
 yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of<br />
 glory.<br />

                    For thine is the kingdom,<br />
             and the power, and the glory, for ever.<br />
<br />
    The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; . . . thy<br />
 throne [is] established of old: thou [art] from everlasting.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] . . . great in power.--If God [be] for us, who<br />
 [can be] against us?--Our God whom we serve is able to deliver<br />
 us.--My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and<br />
 no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.--<br />
 Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<br />
<br />
    Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give<br />
 glory.--Thine, O LORD, [is] the greatness, and the power, and<br />
 the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all [that is]<br />
 in the heaven and in the earth [is thine]; thine [is] the<br />
 kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. . . .<br />
 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious<br />
 name. But who [am] I, and what [is] my people, that we should be<br />
 able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things<br />
 [come] of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
       One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side,<br />
          and forthwith came there out blood and water.<br />
<br />
    Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made<br />
 with you.--The life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have<br />
 given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your<br />
 souls.--For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of<br />
 goats should take away sins.<br />
<br />
    [Jesus] said unto them, This is my blood of the new<br />
 testament, which is shed for many.--By his own blood he entered<br />
 in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption<br />
 [for us].--Peace through the blood of his cross.<br />
<br />
    Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,<br />
 [as] silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of<br />
 Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: . . .<br />
 manifest in these last times for you.<br />
<br />
  . Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be<br />
 clean: . . . from all your idols, will I cleanse you.--Let us<br />
 draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having<br />
 our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                              Amen.<br />
<br />
    Amen: the LORD God . . . say so [too].--He who blesseth<br />
 himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth;<br />
 and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of<br />
 truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because<br />
 they are hid from mine eyes.<br />
<br />
    When God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by<br />
 no greater, he sware by himself.--For men verily swear by the<br />
 greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all<br />
 strife. Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the<br />
 heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it]<br />
 by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which [it was]<br />
 impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation,<br />
 who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before<br />
 us.<br />
<br />
    These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness.--<br />
 For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen,<br />
 unto the glory of God by us.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [be] the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth<br />
 wondrous things. And blessed [be] his glorious name for ever.<br />
 . . . Amen, and Amen.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                The LORD shall be thy confidence,<br />
            and shall keep thy foot from being taken.<br />
<br />
    Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of<br />
 wrath shalt thou restrain.--The king's heart [is] in the hand of<br />
 the LORD, [as] the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever<br />
 he will.--When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his<br />
 enemies to be at peace with him.<br />
<br />
    I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I<br />
 hope. My soul [waiteth] for the Lord more than they that watch<br />
 for the morning: [I say, more than] they that watch for the<br />
 morning.--I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me<br />
 from all my fears.<br />
<br />
    The eternal God [is thy] refuge, and underneath [are] the<br />
 everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before<br />
 thee; and shall say, Destroy [them].--Blessed [is] the man that<br />
 trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.<br />
<br />
    What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us,<br />
 who [can be] against us?<br />

                  Consolation in Christ, . . .<br />

<br />
    Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full of<br />
 trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he<br />
 fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.--My flesh and my<br />
 heart faileth: [but] God [is] the strength of my heart, and my<br />
 portion for ever.<br />
<br />
    The Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he<br />
 may abide with you for ever.--The Holy Ghost, whom the Father<br />
 will send in my name.--Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our<br />
 Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all<br />
 comfort; Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may<br />
 be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort<br />
 wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br />
<br />
    If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them<br />
 also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. And so shall<br />
 we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with<br />
 these words.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
        I delight in the law of God after the inward man.<br />
<br />
    O how love I thy law! it [is] my meditation all the day.--Thy<br />
 words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me<br />
 the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.--I sat down under his<br />
 shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my<br />
 taste.--I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my<br />
 necessary [food].<br />
<br />
    I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within<br />
 my heart.--My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to<br />
 finish his work.<br />
<br />
    The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart:<br />
 the commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.<br />
 . . . More to be desired [are they] than gold, yea, than much<br />
 fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.--Be ye<br />
 doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own<br />
 selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he<br />
 is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.<br />

                  The LORD thy God accept thee.<br />
<br />
    Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, [and] bow myself<br />
 before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt<br />
 offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the LORD be pleased<br />
 with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of<br />
 oil? shall I give my firstborn [for] my transgression, the fruit<br />
 of my body [for] the sin of my soul?  He hath shewed thee, O<br />
 man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but<br />
 to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy<br />
 God?<br />
<br />
    We are all as an unclean [thing], and all our righteousnesses<br />
 [are] as filthy rags.--There is none righteous, no, not one.--<br />
 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being<br />
 justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in<br />
 Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation<br />
 through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the<br />
 remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br />
 to declare . . . at this time his righteousness: that he might<br />
 be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br />
<br />
    Accepted in the beloved.--Ye are complete in him.<br />

 what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we<br />
 should be called the sons of God.<br />
<br />
    [His] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things.--If<br />
 children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ;<br />
 if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also<br />
 glorified together.<br />
<br />
    I and [my] Father are one.--The Father [is] in me, and I in<br />
 him.--My Father, and your Father; . . . my God, and your God.--I<br />
 in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.<br />
<br />
    The church, which is his body, the fulness of him that<br />
 filleth all in all.<br />

 ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,<br />
 perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br />

      If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.<br />

    There was . . . a strife among them, which of them should be<br />
 accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the<br />
 Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise<br />
 authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye [shall] not<br />
 [be] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the<br />
 younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For<br />
 whether [is] greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that<br />
 serveth? [is] not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as<br />
 he that serveth.--Even as the Son of man came not to be<br />
 ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom<br />
 for many.<br />
<br />
    Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his<br />
 hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; he riseth<br />
 from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and<br />
 girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and<br />
 began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the<br />
 towel wherewith he was girded.<br />

 the LORD [is] the strength of my life; of whom shall I be<br />
 afraid?<br />
<br />
    Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is]<br />
 stayed [on thee]: because he trusteth in thee.--He shall not be<br />
 afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the<br />
 LORD. His heart [is] established, he shall not be afraid, until<br />
 he see [his desire] upon his enemies.<br />
<br />
    What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.--In the time of<br />
 trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his<br />
 tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And<br />
 now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about<br />
 me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;<br />
 I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.<br />

 you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you]. To him [be]<br />

       in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.<br />
<br />
    A little that a righteous man hath [is] better than the<br />
 riches of many wicked.--Better [is] little with the fear of the<br />
 LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.--Godliness with<br />
 contentment is great gain. . . . Having food and raiment let us<br />
 be therewith content.<br />
<br />
    Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food<br />
 convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny [thee], and say, Who<br />
 [is] the LORD?  or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name<br />
 of my God [in vain].--Give us this day our daily bread.<br />
<br />
    Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye<br />
 shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not<br />
 the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?--When I sent<br />
 you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?<br />
 And they said, Nothing.--[Let your] conversation [be] without<br />
 covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for<br />
 he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<br />

                It is the spirit that quickeneth.<br />
<br />
    The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was<br />
 made] a quickening spirit.--That which is born of the flesh is<br />
 flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.--Not by<br />
 works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his<br />
 mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing<br />
 of the Holy Ghost.<br />
<br />
    If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.<br />
 And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin;<br />
 but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness. But if the<br />
 Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,<br />
 he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your<br />
 mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<br />
<br />
    I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life<br />
 which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of<br />
 God.--Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but<br />
 alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />

    I forgat prosperity. And I said, My strength and my hope is<br />
 perished from the LORD.--Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?<br />
 arise, cast [us] not off for ever.--Why sayest thou, O Jacob,<br />
 and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my<br />
 judgment is passed over from my God?--In a little wrath I hid my<br />
 face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will<br />
 I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.<br />
<br />
    Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou<br />
 disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him,<br />
 [who is] the health of my countenance, and my God.--[We are]<br />
 troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed,<br />
 but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but<br />
 not destroyed.<br />

              [When] the poor and needy seek water,<br />
    and [there is] none, [and] their tongue faileth for thirst,<br />
                   I the LORD will hear them.<br />
<br />
    [There be] many that say, Who will shew us [any] good?--What<br />
 hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart,<br />
 wherein he hath laboured under the sun? For all his days [are]<br />
 sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest<br />
 in the night.--All [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.--They<br />
 have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, [and] hewed them<br />
 out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<br />
<br />
    Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--I will<br />
 pour water upon him that is thirsty.--Blessed [are] they which<br />
 do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be<br />
 filled.<br />
<br />
    O God, thou [art] my God; early will I seek thee: my soul<br />
 thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and<br />
 thirsty land, where no water is.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
   Lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world.<br />
<br />
    If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that<br />
 they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is<br />
 in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my<br />
 name, there am I in the midst of them.--He that hath my<br />
 commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he<br />
 that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,<br />
 and will manifest myself to him.<br />
<br />
    Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and<br />
 not unto the world? . . . If a man love me, he will keep my<br />
 words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,<br />
 and make our abode with him.<br />
<br />
    Unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to<br />
 present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with<br />
 exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and<br />
 majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br />

<br />
    I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from<br />
 whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.--The heavens and<br />
 the earth, which are now, . . . are kept in store, reserved unto<br />
 fire against the day of judgment.<br />
<br />
    God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in<br />
 trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be<br />
 removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of<br />
 the sea; [though] the waters thereof roar [and] be troubled,<br />
 [though] the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.--Ye<br />
 shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not<br />
 troubled.<br />
<br />
    We have a building of God, an house not made with hands,<br />
 eternal in the heavens.--We . . . look for new heavens and a new<br />
 earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved,<br />
 seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be<br />
 found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br />

                       The LORD reigneth.<br />
<br />
    Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my<br />
 presence, which have placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea<br />
 by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the<br />
 waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though<br />
 they roar, yet can they not pass over it?--Promotion [cometh]<br />
 neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.<br />
 But God [is] the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up<br />
 another.<br />
<br />
    He changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and<br />
 setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge<br />
 to them that know understanding.--Ye shall hear of wars and<br />
 rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.<br />
<br />
    If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?--Are not two<br />
 sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on<br />
 the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head<br />
 are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value<br />
 than many sparrows.<br />

                    Take heed to your spirit.<br />
<br />
    Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we<br />
 forbad him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said<br />
 unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against us is for<br />
 us.--Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from<br />
 heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he . . .<br />
 rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are<br />
 of.<br />
<br />
    Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. And Joshua the son<br />
 of Nun . . . answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. And<br />
 Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that<br />
 all the LORD'S people were prophets, [and] that the LORD would<br />
 put his spirit upon them!<br />
<br />
    The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,<br />
 gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.--And they<br />
 that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections<br />
 and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the<br />
 Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one<br />
 another, envying one another.<br />

<br />
    Himself took our infirmities, and bare [our] sicknesses.<br />
<br />
    Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be<br />
 cleansed two birds alive [and] clean, and cedar wood, and<br />
 scarlet, and hyssop: and the priest shall command that one of<br />
 the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: as<br />
 for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and<br />
 the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living<br />
 bird in the blood of the bird [that was] killed over the running<br />
 water: and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed<br />
 from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and<br />
 shall let the living bird loose into the open field.<br />
<br />
    Behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his]<br />
 face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst<br />
 make me clean.--And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth<br />
 [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou<br />
 clean. And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy<br />
 departed from him, and he was cleansed.<br />

 thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not<br />

 is] written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy<br />
 law [is] within my heart.--I lay down my life, that I might take<br />
 it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.<br />
 I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.<br />
<br />
    [There is] no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour;<br />
 [there is] none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all<br />

    Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand<br />
 against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh<br />
 and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against<br />
 the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual<br />
 wickedness in high [places]. Wherefore take unto you the whole<br />
 armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,<br />
 and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your<br />
 loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of<br />
 righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the<br />

 wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the<br />

 calamity: but the LORD was my stay. He brought me forth also<br />
 into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br />
<br />
    I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise [shall]<br />
 continually [be] in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in<br />
 the LORD: the humble shall hear [thereof], and be glad. O<br />
 magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. I<br />

<br />
    Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up<br />
 his tender mercies?--I said in my haste, I am cut off from<br />
 before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my<br />
 supplications when I cried unto thee.<br />
<br />
    Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night<br />
 unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will<br />
 avenge them speedily.--Wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.<br />
 --Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself<br />

<br />
    Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or [being] his<br />
 counsellor hath taught him?<br />
<br />
    God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound<br />

 confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the<br />
 world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea],<br />

 that no flesh should glory in his presence.<br />

    A continual burnt offering throughout your generations [at]<br />
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD:<br />
 where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.--In all places<br />
 where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless<br />
 thee.<br />
<br />
    For where two or three are gathered together in my name,<br />
 there am I in the midst of them.<br />
<br />
    The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall<br />
 worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father<br />
 seeketh such to worship him. God [is] a Spirit: and they that<br />
 worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.<br />
<br />
    Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the<br />
 Spirit.--Pray without ceasing.<br />

           His name shall be called . . . Counsellor.<br />
<br />
    The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of<br />
 wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the<br />
 spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; and shall make<br />
 him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD.<br />
<br />
    Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?--<br />
 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice [is] to the sons of man. O<br />
 ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an<br />
 understanding heart. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things;<br />
 and the opening of my lips [shall be] right things.--Counsel<br />
 [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I [am] understanding; I have<br />
 strength.<br />
<br />
    The LORD of hosts . . . is wonderful in counsel, [and]<br />
 excellent in working.--If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of<br />
 God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and<br />
 it shall be given him.--Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;<br />
 and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways<br />
 acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                 Ever follow that which is good.<br />
<br />
    For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also<br />
 suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow<br />
 his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:<br />
 who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; . . . but committed<br />
 [himself] to him that judgeth righteously.--Consider him that<br />
 endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye<br />
 be wearied and faint in your minds.<br />
<br />
    Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so<br />
 easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is<br />
 set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of<br />
 [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the<br />
 cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of<br />
 the throne of God.<br />
<br />
    Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever<br />
 things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if<br />
 [there be] any praise, think on these things.<br />

 thy sword upon [thy] thigh, O [most] mighty, with thy glory and<br />
 thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously. . . . Thy<br />
 throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy<br />
 kingdom [is] a right sceptre.--Thou spakest in vision to thy<br />
 holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon [one that is]<br />
 mighty.--The man [that is] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts.<br />
<br />
    Behold, God [is] my salvation; I will trust, and not be<br />
 afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH [is] my strength and [my] song; he<br />
 also is become my salvation.--Thanks [be] unto God, which always<br />
 causeth us to triumph in Christ.<br />
<br />
    Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to<br />
 present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with<br />
 exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and<br />
 majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.<br />

<br />
    Unto you . . . which believe [he is] precious: but unto them<br />
 which be disobedient, . . . and a stone of stumbling, and a rock<br />
 of offence.--The way of the LORD [is] strength to the upright:<br />
 but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity.<br />
<br />
    He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.--Whoso [is] wise,<br />
 and will observe these [things], even they shall understand the<br />
 lovingkindness of the LORD.--The light of the body is the eye:<br />
 if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full<br />

 doctrine, whether it be of God.--Whosoever hath, to him shall be<br />
 given, and he shall have more abundance.<br />

 them, and they follow me.<br />

 seen me hath seen the Father.--Behold I and the children which<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                  Now for a season, if need be,<br />
        ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial<br />
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto<br />
 you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's<br />
 sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be<br />
 glad also with exceeding joy.--The exhortation which speaketh<br />
 unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the<br />
 chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.<br />
 --Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but<br />
 grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit<br />
 of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.<br />
<br />
    We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the<br />
 feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like<br />
 as [we are, yet] without sin.--For in that he himself hath<br />
 suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are<br />
 tempted.--God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be<br />
 tempted above that ye are able.<br />

<br />
                      The Prince of Peace.<br />

 with judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people,<br />
 and the little hills, by righteousness. . . . He shall come down<br />
 like rain upon the mown grass: as showers [that] water the<br />
 earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance<br />
 of peace so long as the moon endureth.--Glory to God . . . on<br />
 earth peace, good will toward men.<br />
<br />
    Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring<br />
 from on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in<br />
 darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into<br />
 the way of peace.--Peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all).<br />
<br />
    These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have<br />
 peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good<br />
 cheer; I have overcome the world.--Peace I leave with you, my<br />
 peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.<br />
 --The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep<br />
 your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br />

    Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye<br />
 make [any other] like it, after the composition of it: it [is]<br />
 holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you.--One Spirit.--Diversities<br />
 of gifts, but the same Spirit.<br />
<br />
    Thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above<br />
 thy fellows.--God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost<br />
 and with power.--God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto<br />
 him].<br />
<br />
    Of his fulness have all we received.--As the same anointing<br />
 teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and<br />
 even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.--He which<br />
 stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is]<br />

 there is no law.<br />

  Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<br />

 thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth:<br />
 so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.--For what [is]<br />
 your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little<br />
 time, and then vanisheth away.--The world passeth away, and the<br />
 lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for<br />

    LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,<br />
 what it [is; that] I may know how frail I [am].--When they shall<br />
 say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them,<br />
 as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.<br />

 overtake you as a thief.<br />

    The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with<br />

 therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine<br />
 hand, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. And they pitched<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
           I have laid help upon [one that is] mighty;<br />
         I have exalted [one] chosen out of the people.<br />
<br />
    I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; and beside me [there is] no<br />
 saviour.--[There is] one God, and one mediator between God and<br />
 men, the man Christ Jesus.--There is none other name under<br />
 heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.<br />
<br />
    The mighty God.--[Who] made himself of no reputation, and<br />
 took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the<br />
 likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled<br />
 himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the<br />
 cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him<br />
 a name which is above every name.--We see Jesus, who was made a<br />
 little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned<br />
 with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste<br />
 death for every man.--Forasmuch . . . as the children are<br />
 partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part<br />
 of the same.<br />

               Gather my saints together unto me;<br />
      those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.<br />
<br />
    Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto<br />
 them that look for him shall he appear the second time without<br />
 sin unto salvation.--He is the mediator of the new testament,<br />
 that by means of death, . . . they which are called might<br />
 receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<br />
<br />
    Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be<br />
 with me where I am.--Then shall he send his angels, and shall<br />
 gather together his elect from the four winds, from the<br />
 uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.--If<br />
 [any] of thine be driven out unto the outmost [parts] of heaven,<br />
 from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence<br />
 will he fetch thee.<br />
<br />
    The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive<br />
 [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the<br />
 clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be<br />
 with the Lord.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                  Fruitful in every good work,<br />
             and increasing in the knowledge of God.<br />
<br />
    I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye<br />
 present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto<br />
 God, [which is] your reasonable service. And be not conformed to<br />
 this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,<br />
 that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and<br />
 perfect, will of God.--As ye have yielded your members servants<br />
 to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield<br />
 your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.--In Christ<br />
 Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor<br />
 uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk<br />
 according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy.<br />
<br />
    Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so<br />
 shall ye be my disciples.--I have chosen you, and ordained you,<br />
 that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit<br />
 should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my<br />
 name, he may give it you.<br />

<br />
<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
               I sought him, but I found him not.<br />
<br />
    Return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine<br />
 iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto<br />
 him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously.<br />
<br />
    Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. . . .<br />
 but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust,<br />
 and enticed. . . . Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good<br />
 gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from<br />
 the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither<br />
 shadow of turning.<br />
<br />
    Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen<br />
 thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.--[It is] good that [a<br />
 man] should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the<br />
 LORD.--Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and<br />
 night unto him, though he bear long with them?<br />
<br />
    Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him [cometh] my<br />
 salvation.--My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation<br />
 [is] from him.<br />

<br />
    I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the<br />
 paths of judgment.<br />
<br />
    Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,<br />
 and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.--In all<br />
 their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence<br />
 saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he<br />
 bare them, and carried them all the days of old.<br />
<br />
    They got not the land in possession by their own sword,<br />
 neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and<br />
 thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst<br />
 a favour unto them.--So didst thou lead thy people, to make<br />
 thyself a glorious name.<br />
<br />
    Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine<br />
 enemies; make thy way straight before my face.--O send out thy<br />
 light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto<br />
 thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. Then will I go unto the<br />
 altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will<br />
 I praise thee, O God my God.<br />

    The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br />
 --The chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his<br />

    Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that<br />
 he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by<br />
 the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,<br />
 not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it<br />
 should be holy and without blemish.--To her was granted that she<br />
 should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine<br />
 linen is the righteousness of saints.--Let us draw near with a<br />
 true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts<br />
 sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with<br />
 pure water.<br />
<br />
    Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? [It is]<br />
 God that justifieth.--Blessed [is he whose] transgression [is]<br />

 whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit [there<br />
 is] no guile.<br />

                 Godly sorrow worketh repentance<br />

<br />
    Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,<br />
 Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went<br />
 out, and wept bitterly.--If we confess our sins, he is faithful<br />
 and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all<br />
 unrighteousness.--The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us<br />
 from all sin.<br />
<br />
    Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not<br />
 able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head:<br />
 therefore my heart faileth me. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver<br />
 me: O LORD, make haste to help me.<br />
<br />
    Turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on<br />
 thy God continually.<br />
<br />
    The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a<br />
 contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.--He healeth the<br />
 broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.--He hath shewed<br />
 thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of<br />
 thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly<br />
 with thy God?<br />

    As chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway<br />
 rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and<br />

<br />
    [We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are]<br />
 perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken;<br />
 cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body<br />
 the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might<br />
 be made manifest in our body.--For which cause we faint not; but<br />
 though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed<br />
 day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,<br />
 worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of<br />
 glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at<br />
 the things which are not seen.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and<br />
 be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.<br />

    Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of<br />
 incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for<br />
 ever.--Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.--<br />
 Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot<br />
 enter into the kingdom of God.--Not by works of righteousness<br />
 which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by<br />
 the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.--<br />
 Thy word hath quickened me.<br />
<br />
    The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul: the<br />
 testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple. The<br />
 statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart: the<br />
 commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes.<br />

 my name, I will do [it]. . . . And I will pray the Father, and<br />
 he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you<br />
 for ever; [even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot<br />
 receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye<br />
 know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.--[There<br />

 of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and<br />
 Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you<br />

 the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he<br />

 thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe [nor] any tool<br />
 of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.<br />

 Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus<br />
 Christ himself being the chief corner [stone]; in whom all the<br />

 angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn,<br />
 which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to<br />
 the spirits of just men made perfect.<br />
<br />
    These all died in faith, not having received the promises,<br />
 but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and<br />
 embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and<br />
 pilgrims on the earth.--Our conversation is in heaven; from<br />
 whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who<br />
 shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto<br />
 his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able<br />
 even to subdue all things unto himself.--The Father . . . hath<br />
 delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated<br />
 [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son.<br />
<br />
    As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which<br />
 war against the soul.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                   Thy thoughts are very deep.<br />
<br />
    We . . . do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye<br />
 might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and<br />
 spiritual understanding.--That Christ may dwell in your hearts<br />
 by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be<br />
 able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and<br />
 length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ,<br />
 which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the<br />
 fulness of God.<br />
<br />
    O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of<br />
 God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past<br />
 finding out!--For my thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither<br />
 [are] your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For [as] the heavens<br />
 are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways,<br />
 and my thoughts than your thoughts.--Many, O LORD my God, [are]<br />
 thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done, and thy thoughts<br />
 [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto<br />
 thee: [if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more<br />
 than can be numbered.<br />

 They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.--He<br />
 that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.<br />
<br />
    To him that soweth righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.--<br />
 He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life<br />
 everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due<br />
 season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore<br />
 opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them<br />
 who are of the household of faith.<br />
<br />
    There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and [there is]<br />
 that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it tendeth] to poverty.<br />
 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall<br />
 be watered also himself.--He which soweth sparingly shall reap<br />
 also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also<br />
 bountifully.<br />

<br />
     He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.<br />
<br />
    Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies<br />
 [are] great.--I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave<br />
 thee altogether unpunished.--He will not always chide: neither<br />
 will he keep [his anger] for ever. He hath not dealt with us<br />
 after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.--<br />
 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we [are] dust.--I<br />
 will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br />
<br />
    God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted<br />
 above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a<br />
 way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].--Satan hath<br />
 desired [to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat: but I<br />
 have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.<br />
<br />
    Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the<br />
 needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from<br />
 the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm<br />
 [against] the wall.<br />

      I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes<br />

<br />
    The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with<br />
 this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the<br />
 uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and,<br />
 behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.--We beheld his glory,<br />
 the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace<br />
 and truth.<br />
<br />
    My speech and my preaching [was] . . . in demonstration of<br />
 the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the<br />
 wisdom of men, but in the power of God.--But as it is written,<br />
 Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the<br />
 heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that<br />
 love him. But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit:<br />
 for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of<br />
 God.<br />

 him as he is.--In my flesh shall I see God.--I shall be<br />
 satisfied.<br />

               By their fruits ye shall know them.<br />
<br />
    Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth<br />
 righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.--Doth a<br />
 fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?<br />
 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a<br />
 vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and<br />
 fresh. Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?<br />
 let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness<br />
 of wisdom.--Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles:<br />
 that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by<br />
 [your] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the<br />
 day of visitation.<br />
<br />
    Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make<br />
 the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known<br />
 by [his] fruit.--A good man out of the good treasure of the<br />
 heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the<br />
 evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.<br />

 [is] my footstool.<br />
<br />
    Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?  behold,<br />
 heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much<br />
 less this house which I have built!<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it [is] a little<br />
 while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea,<br />
 and the dry [land]; and I will shake all nations, and the desire<br />
 of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with<br />
 glory, saith the LORD of hosts. . . . The glory of this latter<br />
 house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of<br />
 hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of<br />
 hosts.<br />
<br />
    I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and<br />
 the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.<br />
 . . . And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,<br />
 the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with<br />
 them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be<br />
 with them, [and be] their God.<br />

<br />
    When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee;<br />
 and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou<br />
 walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither<br />
 shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I [am] the LORD thy God,<br />
 the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.--I will bring the blind by<br />
 a way [that] they knew not; I will lead them in paths [that]<br />
 they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and<br />
 crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and<br />
 not forsake them.<br />
<br />
    Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br />
 I will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy<br />
 staff they comfort me.--What time I am afraid, I will trust in<br />
 thee. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust;<br />
 I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.--The LORD [is] my<br />
 light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD [is] the<br />
 strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br />

<br />
         One God, and one mediator between God and men,<br />

<br />
    Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD.--Now a<br />
 mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.<br />
<br />
    We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,<br />
 we have done wickedly. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in<br />
 Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies. . . .<br />
 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his<br />
 chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath,<br />
 lest he should destroy [them].<br />
<br />
    Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,<br />
 consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ<br />
 Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses<br />
 [was faithful] in all his house.<br />
<br />
    He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was<br />
 established upon better promises.--I will be merciful to their<br />
 unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I<br />
 remember no more.<br />

 hear; for I [am] gracious.--I will not cast them away, neither<br />
 will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my<br />
 covenant with them: for I [am] the LORD their God.--I will<br />
 remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I<br />
 will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.<br />
<br />
    Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though<br />
 your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though<br />
 they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--Let the wicked<br />
 forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let<br />
 him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and<br />
 to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.--Lord, remember me<br />
 when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him,<br />
 Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in<br />
 paradise.<br />

    A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall<br />

<br />
                          His dear Son.<br />

    Lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in<br />
 whom I am well pleased.--Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine<br />
 elect, [in whom] my soul delighteth.--The only begotten Son,<br />
 which is in the bosom of the Father.<br />
<br />
    In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because<br />
 that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we<br />
 might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God,<br />
 but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation<br />
 for our sins.--And we have known and believed the love that God<br />
 hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth<br />
 in God, and God in him.<br />
<br />
    The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they<br />
 may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that<br />
 they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know<br />
 that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved<br />
 me.--Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon<br />
 us, that we should be called the sons of God.<br />

    O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:<br />
 nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt].<br />
<br />

 what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit maketh<br />
 intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And<br />
 he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the<br />
 Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according<br />
 to [the will of] God.--This is the confidence that we have in<br />
 him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth<br />
 us. When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide<br />
 you into all truth.<br />

 all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them<br />

 we are in him.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                  What doest thou here, Elijah?<br />
<br />
    He knoweth the way that I take.--O LORD, thou hast searched<br />
 me, and known [me]. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine<br />
 uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou<br />
 compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted [with]<br />
 all my ways.--Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither<br />
 shall I flee from thy presence?--[If] I take the wings of the<br />
 morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even<br />
 there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.<br />
<br />
    Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are.--The fear<br />
 of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD<br />
 shall be safe.--Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast<br />
 down: for the LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.--A just [man]<br />
 falleth seven times, and riseth up again.<br />
<br />
    Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall<br />
 reap, if we faint not.--The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the<br />
 flesh [is] weak.--Like as a father pitieth [his] children, [so]<br />
 the LORD pitieth them that fear him.<br />

                 Being then made free from sin,<br />
            ye became the servants of righteousness.<br />
<br />
    Ye cannot serve God and mammon.--When ye were the servants of<br />
 sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in<br />
 those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those<br />
 things [is] death. But now being made free from sin, and become<br />
 servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end<br />
 everlasting life.<br />
<br />
    Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one<br />
 that believeth.<br />
<br />
    If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there<br />
 shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my]<br />
 Father honour.--Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am<br />
 meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br />
 For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.<br />
<br />
    O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion<br />
 over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.--I<br />
 will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my<br />
 heart.<br />

    Manasseh . . . did [that which was] evil in the sight of the<br />
 LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, . . . and he reared<br />
 up altars for Baal. . . . And he built altars for all the host<br />
 of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.--And he<br />
 made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used<br />
 enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he<br />
 wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke<br />
 [him] to anger.--And when he was in affliction, he besought the<br />
 LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his<br />
 fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and<br />
 heard his supplication.<br />
<br />
    Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though<br />
 your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though<br />
 they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--The Lord is<br />
 . . . longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should<br />
 perish.<br />

                  The LORD delighteth in thee.<br />
<br />
    Thus saith the LORD that created thee, . . . Fear not: for I<br />
 have redeemed thee, I have called [thee] by thy name; thou [art]<br />
 mine.--Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not<br />
 have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget,<br />
 yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the<br />
 palms of [my] hands; thy walls [are] continually before me.<br />
<br />
    The steps of a [good] man are ordered by the LORD: and he<br />
 delighteth in his way.--My delights [were] with the sons of men.<br />
 --The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that<br />
 hope in his mercy.--They shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts,<br />
 in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as<br />
 a man spareth his own son that serveth him.<br />
<br />
    You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind<br />
 by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his<br />
 flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and<br />
 unreproveable in his sight.<br />

             The sorrow of the world worketh death.<br />
<br />
    When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he<br />
 saddled [his] ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to<br />
 his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,<br />
 and died.--A wounded spirit who can bear?<br />
<br />
    [Is there] no balm in Gilead; [is there] no physician there?<br />
 why then is not the health of the daughter of my people<br />
 recovered?--The LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings<br />
 unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,<br />
 . . . to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn<br />
 in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for<br />
 mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.--<br />
 Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I<br />
 will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for<br />
 I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your<br />
 souls. For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
        The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.<br />
<br />
    I saw . . . the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted<br />
 up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the<br />
 seraphims. . . . And one cried unto another, and said, Holy,<br />
 holy, holy, [is] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth [is] full of<br />
 his glory.--These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and<br />
 spake of him.--Upon the likeness of the throne [was] the<br />
 likeness . . . of a man above upon it. . . . As the appearance<br />
 of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the<br />
 appearance of the brightness round about. This [was] the<br />
 appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.<br />
<br />
    I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. . . . And he said, Thou<br />
 canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.<br />
 --No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which<br />
 is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].--God, who<br />
 commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our<br />
 hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God<br />
 in the face of Jesus Christ.<br />

 unto her husband with her; and he did eat.--Did not Achan the<br />
 son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath<br />
 fell on all the congregation of Israel?  and that man perished<br />
 not alone in his iniquity.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil.<br />
<br />
    Wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to<br />
 destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.<br />
<br />
    None of us liveth to himself.--Brethren, ye have been called<br />
 unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the<br />
 flesh, but by love serve one another.--Take heed lest by any<br />
 means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that<br />
 are weak.--When ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their<br />
 weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.<br />
<br />
    All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one<br />
 to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us<br />
 all.<br />

             As the body without the spirit is dead,<br />

<br />
    Not every one that saith, . . . Lord, Lord, shall enter into<br />
 the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father<br />
 which is in heaven.--Holiness, without which no man shall see<br />
 the Lord.--Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br />
 and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to<br />
 patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to<br />
 brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and<br />
 abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor<br />
 unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he<br />
 that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and<br />
 hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore<br />
 the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and<br />
 election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.<br />
<br />
    By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of<br />
 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: not of works, lest any man<br />
 should boast.<br />

        As the children are partakers of flesh and blood,<br />

          that [he might] deliver them who through fear<br />
       of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.<br />
<br />
    O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy<br />
 victory?--Thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory<br />
 through our Lord Jesus Christ.--For which cause we faint not;<br />
 but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is<br />
 renewed day by day.<br />
<br />
    We know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were<br />
 dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with<br />
 hands, eternal in the heavens.--Therefore [we are] always<br />
 confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we<br />
 are absent from the Lord. . . . We are . . . willing rather to<br />
 be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br />
<br />
    Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe<br />
 also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were]<br />
 not [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for<br />
 you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come<br />
 again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye<br />
 may be also.<br />

 after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of<br />
 my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his<br />
 temple.<br />
<br />
    Blessed [are] they which do hunger and thirst after<br />
 righteousness: for they shall be filled.--He hath filled the<br />
 hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br />
<br />
    He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul<br />
 with goodness.--I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me<br />
 shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never<br />
 thirst.<br />
<br />
    How excellent [is] thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the<br />
 children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.<br />
 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy<br />
 house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy<br />
 pleasures. For with thee [is] the fountain of life: in thy light<br />
 shall we see light.<br />

    What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath<br />
 faith, and have not works? can faith save him?--Even so faith,<br />
 if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<br />
<br />
    By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he<br />
 that had received the promises offered up his only begotten<br />
 [son], of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be<br />
 called: accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even<br />
 from the dead.--Was not Abraham our father justified by works,<br />
 when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?--Ye see then<br />
 how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.<br />
<br />
    Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth<br />
 [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the<br />
 work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br />
<br />
    By their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith<br />
 unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but<br />

    Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to<br />

    Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto<br />
 them, Peace [be] unto you.--Peace I leave with you, my peace I<br />

 things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said,<br />
 Behold, I make all things new.<br />

<br />
              Ye have an unction from the Holy One,<br />
                     and ye know all things.<br />
<br />
    God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with<br />
 power.--It pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness<br />
 dwell.--Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for<br />
 grace.<br />
<br />
    Thou anointest my head with oil.--The anointing which ye have<br />
 received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man<br />
 teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,<br />
 and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye<br />
 shall abide in him.<br />
<br />
    The Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father<br />
 will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring<br />
 all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.<br />
<br />
    The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what<br />
 we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh<br />
 intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
      Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.<br />
<br />
    If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an<br />
 heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of<br />
 the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through<br />
 the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge<br />
 your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?--The<br />
 blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of]<br />
 Abel.<br />
<br />
    We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of<br />
 sins, according to the riches of his grace;<br />
<br />
    When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people<br />
 according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats,<br />
 with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the<br />
 book, and all the people. . . . Moreover he sprinkled with blood<br />
 both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. And<br />
 almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without<br />
 shedding of blood is no remission.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                     I would seek unto God,<br />
              and unto God would I commit my cause.<br />
<br />
    Is any thing too hard for the LORD?--Commit thy way unto the<br />
 LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass.--Be<br />
 careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and<br />
 supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known<br />
 unto God.--Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for<br />
 you.<br />
<br />
    Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers,<br />
 and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD,<br />
 and spread it before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed unto the<br />
 LORD.<br />
<br />
    It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;<br />
 and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.--The effectual<br />
 fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.<br />
<br />
    I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my<br />
 supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,<br />
 therefore will I call upon [him] as long as I live.<br />

 shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: when they go into<br />
 the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water,<br />
 that they die not; . . . they shall wash their hands and their<br />
 feet, that they die not.--Your body is the temple of the Holy<br />
 Ghost [which is] in you.--If any man defile the temple of God,<br />
 him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which<br />
 [temple] ye are.<br />
<br />
    In my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and<br />
 mine eyes shall behold, and not another.--There shall in no wise<br />
 enter into it any thing that defileth.--[Thou art] of purer eyes<br />
 than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.--I beseech<br />
 you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present<br />
 your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,<br />
 [which is] your reasonable service.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                  Where shall wisdom be found?<br />
<br />
   If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to<br />
 all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given<br />
 him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that<br />
 wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and<br />
 tossed.--Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not<br />
 unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him,<br />
 and he shall direct thy paths.--The only wise God.--Be not wise<br />
 in thine own eyes.<br />
<br />
    Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I [am] a child. But<br />
 the LORD said unto me, Say not, I [am] a child: for thou shalt<br />
 go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee<br />
 thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces: for I [am] with<br />
 thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.<br />
<br />
    Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give<br />
 [it] you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye<br />
 shall receive, that your joy may be full.--All things,<br />
 whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.<br />

 I fly away, and be at rest. . . . I would hasten my escape from<br />
 the windy storm [and] tempest.<br />
<br />
    In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with<br />
 our house which is from heaven. . . . For we that are in [this]<br />
 tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be<br />
 unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed<br />
 up of life.--Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ;<br />
 which is far better.<br />
<br />
    Let us run with patience the race that is set before us,<br />
 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who<br />
 for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising<br />
 the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of<br />
 God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners<br />
 against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.<br />

    Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.<br />

<br />
    Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things<br />
 which he suffered.--We suffer with [him], that we may be also<br />
 glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this<br />
 present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory<br />
 which shall be revealed in us.<br />
<br />
    He knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I<br />
 shall come forth as gold. My foot hath held his steps, his way<br />
 have I kept, and not declined.<br />
<br />
    Thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led<br />
 thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, [and]<br />
 to prove thee, to know what [was] in thine heart, whether thou<br />
 wouldest keep his commandments, or no.--Thou shalt also consider<br />
 in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD<br />
 thy God chasteneth thee. Therefore thou shalt keep the<br />
 commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to<br />
 fear him.<br />

                By strength shall no man prevail.<br />

    Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a<br />
 sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee<br />
 in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of<br />
 Israel, whom thou hast defied.--And David put his hand in his<br />
 bag, and took thence a stone, and slang [it], and smote the<br />
 Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his<br />
 forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. So David<br />
 prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone.<br />
<br />
    There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty<br />
 man is not delivered by much strength. . . . Behold, the eye of<br />
 the LORD [is] upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in<br />
 his mercy.--Both riches and honour [come] of thee, and thou<br />
 reignest over all; and in thine hand [is] power and might; and<br />
 in thine hand [it is] to make great, and to give strength unto<br />
 all.<br />
<br />
    I . . . glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may<br />
 rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in<br />
 reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for<br />
 Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.<br />

<br />
    Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as<br />
 of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God.--A man can<br />
 receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.--No man can<br />
 come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I<br />
 will raise him up at the last day.--And I will give them one<br />
 heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever.<br />
<br />
    Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every<br />
 perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of<br />
 lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<br />
 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we<br />
 should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br />
<br />
    For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good<br />
 works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in<br />
 them.<br />

 wrought all our works in us.<br />

    The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.<br />

    In the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee;<br />
 the desire of [our] soul [is] to thy name, and to the<br />
 remembrance of thee. With my soul have I desired thee in the<br />
 night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.<br />
<br />
    I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good<br />
 thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that<br />
 which is good I find not.--For I delight in the law of God after<br />
 the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring<br />
 against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to<br />
 the law of sin which is in my members.--The flesh lusteth<br />
 against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these<br />
 are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the<br />
 things that ye would.<br />
<br />
    I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.--<br />
 Our sufficiency [is] of God.--My grace is sufficient for thee.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      He hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin;<br />
     that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.<br />
<br />
    The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.--Who his<br />
 own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,<br />
 being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose<br />
 stripes ye were healed.--As by one man's disobedience many were<br />
 made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made<br />
 righteous.<br />
<br />
    But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour<br />
 toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have<br />
 done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of<br />
 regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on<br />
 us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being<br />
 justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the<br />
 hope of eternal life.--[There is] therefore now no condemnation<br />
 to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,<br />
 but after the Spirit.<br />

 convert him; let him know, that he which converteth the sinner<br />
 from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and<br />
 shall hide a multitude of sins.--Seeing ye have purified your<br />
 souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned<br />
 love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure<br />
 heart fervently.--Owe no man any thing, but to love one another:<br />

 Lord. . . . We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be<br />
 absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.--With<br />
 Christ; which is far better.--I would not have you to be<br />
 ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye<br />
 sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe<br />
 that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in<br />
 Jesus will God bring with him.<br />
<br />
    I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a<br />
 place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;<br />
 that where I am, [there] ye may be also.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
    No [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.<br />
<br />
    I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able<br />
 to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.--<br />
 The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will<br />
 preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom.--We are more than<br />
 conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that<br />
 neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor<br />
 powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor<br />
 depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from<br />
 the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.--Your life<br />
 is hid with Christ in God.<br />
<br />
    Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and<br />
 heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love<br />
 him?<br />
<br />
    Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,<br />
 which hath loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting consolation<br />
 and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish<br />
 you in every good word and work.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
                   The perfect law of liberty.<br />
<br />
    Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br />
 . . . Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin<br />
 is the servant of sin. . . . If the Son therefore shall make you<br />
 free, ye shall be free indeed.<br />
<br />
    Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath<br />
 made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of<br />
 bondage.--For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only<br />
 [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love<br />
 serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word,<br />
 [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.--Being<br />
 then made free from sin, ye became the servants of<br />
 righteousness.--For the woman which hath an husband is bound by<br />
 the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the<br />
 husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.<br />
<br />
    The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me<br />
 free from the law of sin and death.--I will walk at liberty: for<br />
 I seek thy precepts.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            Let not then your good be evil spoken of.<br />
<br />
    Abstain from all appearance of evil.--Providing for honest<br />
 things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight<br />
 of men.--For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may<br />
 put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.<br />
<br />
    But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or<br />
 [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet<br />
 if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but<br />
 let him glorify God on this behalf.<br />
<br />
    Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not<br />
 liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one<br />
 another.--Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours<br />
 become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.--Whoso shall<br />
 offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were<br />
 better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and<br />
 [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.--Inasmuch as ye<br />
 have done [it] unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye<br />
 have done [it] unto me.<br />

       Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,<br />

<br />
    [It is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our<br />
 salvation nearer than when we believed.--Therefore let us not<br />
 sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober. For they<br />
 that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are<br />
 drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober,<br />
 putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet,<br />
 the hope of salvation.<br />
<br />
    Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the<br />
 LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover<br />
 the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall<br />
 arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.<br />
<br />
    Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope<br />
 to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the<br />
 revelation of Jesus Christ.--Let your loins be girded about, and<br />
 [your] lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that<br />
 wait for their lord.<br />

    Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; for I<br />
 [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee;<br />
 yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.<br />
 --Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.<br />
 Say to them [that are] of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:<br />
 behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [even] God [with] a<br />
 recompence; he will come and save you.--The LORD thy God in the<br />
 midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over<br />
 thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee<br />
 with singing.--Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he<br />
 shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.<br />
<br />
    I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the<br />
 tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them,<br />
 and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with<br />
 them, [and be] their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from<br />
 their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,<br />
 nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former<br />
 things are passed away.<br />

    Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for<br />
 our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do<br />
 [that which is] good in his sight.--We made our prayer unto our<br />
 God, and set a watch against them day and night.<br />
<br />
    Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter<br />
 into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my<br />
 Father which is in heaven.--If any man will do his will, he<br />
 shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.--Then shall we<br />
 know, [if] we follow on to know the LORD.<br />
<br />
    Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.--Watch ye,<br />
 stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.--Not<br />
 slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.<br />

 ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the<br />

 thanksgiving.--Trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD,<br />
 that he might be glorified.--Built upon the foundation of the<br />
 apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief<br />
 corner [stone]; in whom all the building fitly framed together<br />
 groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are<br />
 builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<br />

 adversaries.<br />

 thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be<br />
 burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet<br />
 so as by fire.--We must all appear before the judgment seat of<br />
 Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his]<br />
 body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or<br />
 bad.<br />
<br />
    When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy<br />

 us.<br />

 my praise.--I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby<br />

 iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have<br />
 transgressed against me. And it shall be to me a name of joy, a<br />

 continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to<br />
 his name.<br />

 --Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, . . . glorious in holiness,<br />

 man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<br />

    Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on<br />
 the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in<br />
 Christ Jesus: [who] took upon him the form of a servant.--Even<br />
 the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister,<br />
 and to give his life a ransom for many.--He died for all, that<br />
 they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but<br />
 unto him which died for them, and rose again.<br />

 instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves<br />
 unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your<br />
 members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.--As obedient<br />
 children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former<br />
 lusts in your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is<br />
 holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is<br />
 written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.--Sanctified, and meet for<br />
 the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.<br />

 always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know<br />
 that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.<br />

          Having loved his own which were in the world,<br />

<br />
    I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which<br />
 thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine,<br />
 and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.--I pray not that<br />
 thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou<br />
 shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world,<br />
 even as I am not of the world.<br />
<br />
    As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye<br />
 in my love.--Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay<br />
 down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do<br />
 whatsoever I command you.--A new commandment I give unto you,<br />
 That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love<br />
 one another.<br />
<br />
    He which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it]<br />

 you.--It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom<br />

 which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely<br />

 Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is<br />
 named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his<br />
 glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner<br />
 man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye,<br />
 being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend<br />
 with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth,<br />
 and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth<br />
 knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.<br />

 our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we<br />
 ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with<br />
 groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the<br />
 hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he<br />
 maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of]<br />
 God.--Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the<br />
 Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance.<br />
<br />
    I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast<br />
 quickened me.--The words that I speak unto you, [they] are<br />
 spirit, and [they] are life.--The letter killeth, but the spirit<br />
 giveth life.--If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye<br />
 shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.--This<br />
 is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing<br />
 according to his will, he heareth us.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
    Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<br />
                   but rather reprove [them].<br />
<br />
    Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.<br />
<br />
    Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?<br />
 Purge out therefore the old leaven. . . . I wrote unto you in an<br />
 epistle not to company with fornicators: yet not altogether with<br />
 the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or<br />
 extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out<br />
 of the world. But now I have written unto you not to keep<br />
 company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or<br />
 covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an<br />
 extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.--That ye may be<br />
 blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the<br />
 midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as<br />
 lights in the world.<br />
<br />
    In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of<br />
 silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and<br />
 some to dishonour.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
     Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,<br />
                    that we may obtain mercy,<br />
             and find grace to help in time of need.<br />
<br />
    Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and<br />
 supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known<br />
 unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,<br />
 shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.--Ye have<br />
 not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have<br />
 received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<br />
<br />
    I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.--<br />
 Having therefore, . . . boldness to enter into the holiest by<br />
 the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath<br />
 consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;<br />
 snd [having] an high priest over the house of God. Let us draw<br />
 near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our<br />
 hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed<br />
 with pure water.--We may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper,<br />
 and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.<br />

<br />
    Where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.--The<br />
 law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from<br />
 the law of sin and death.--If the Son . . . shall make you free,<br />
 ye shall be free indeed.<br />
<br />
    Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the<br />
 free.--Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the<br />
 law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in<br />
 Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ,<br />
 and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law<br />
 shall no flesh be justified.<br />
<br />
    Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth<br />
 [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the<br />
 work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.--Stand fast<br />
 therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and<br />
 be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
      Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.<br />
<br />
    Who [is] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the<br />
 voice of his servant, that walketh [in] darkness, and hath no<br />
 light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his<br />
 God.--Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the<br />
 LORD upholdeth [him with] his hand.--The commandment [is] a<br />
 lamp; and the law [is] light.<br />
<br />
    Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall<br />
 arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD [shall be] a light unto<br />
 me. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have<br />
 sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute<br />
 judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I<br />
 shall behold his righteousness.<br />
<br />
    The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be<br />
 single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye<br />
 be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore<br />
 the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that<br />
 darkness!<br />

    He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather<br />
     the lambs with his arm, and carry [them] in his bosom,<br />
       [and] shall gently lead those that are with young.<br />
<br />
    I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue<br />
 with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: . . . I will<br />
 not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.--We have<br />
 not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of<br />
 our infirmities.<br />
<br />
    They brought young children to him, . . . and he took them up<br />
 in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and blessed them.<br />
<br />
    I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant.--The<br />
 Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.--Ye<br />
 were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the<br />
 Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.<br />
<br />
    Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure<br />
 to give you the kingdom.--I will feed my flock, and I will cause<br />
 them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.<br />

                    He hath chosen us in him<br />
               before the foundation of the world.<br />
<br />
    That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.<br />
<br />
    God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through<br />
 sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto<br />
 he called you, . . . to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord<br />
 Jesus Christ.--Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate<br />
 [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the<br />
 firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did<br />
 predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he<br />
 also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.--<br />
 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through<br />
 sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of<br />
 the blood of Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
    A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put<br />
 within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your<br />
 flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.--God hath not<br />
 called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.<br />

           [If] the LORD would make windows in heaven,<br />

<br />
    Have faith in God.--Without faith [it is] impossible to<br />
 please [God].--With God all things are possible.<br />
<br />
    Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I<br />
 no power to deliver?<br />
<br />
    My thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither [are] your ways<br />
 my ways, saith the LORD. For [as] the heavens are higher than<br />
 the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts<br />
 than your thoughts.--Prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of<br />
 hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour<br />
 you out a blessing, that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to<br />
 receive it].<br />
<br />
    Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot<br />
 save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.--LORD, [it is]<br />
 nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that<br />
 have no power.<br />
<br />
    We should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth<br />
 the dead.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
            The days of thy mourning shall be ended.<br />
<br />
    In the world ye shall have tribulation.--The whole creation<br />
 groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only<br />
 [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the<br />
 Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for<br />
 the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.--We that are<br />
 in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we<br />
 would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be<br />
 swallowed up of life.<br />
<br />
    These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have<br />
 washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the<br />
 Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him<br />
 day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne<br />
 shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither<br />
 thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any<br />
 heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall<br />
 feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters:<br />
 and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.<br />

 the green herb have I given you all things.--While the earth<br />
 remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer<br />
 and winter, and day and night shall not cease.<br />
<br />
    The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and<br />
 he knoweth them that trust in him.--God heard the voice of the<br />
 lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and<br />
 said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath<br />
 heard the voice of the lad where he [is]. . . . And God opened<br />
 her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled<br />
 the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.<br />
<br />
    Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we<br />
 drink? . . . for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need<br />
 of all these things.--Trust . . . in the living God, who giveth<br />
 us richly all things to enjoy.<br />

                       Your work of faith.<br />
<br />
    This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath<br />
 sent.<br />
<br />
    Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.--Faith<br />
 which worketh by love.--He that soweth to his flesh shall of the<br />
 flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of<br />
 the Spirit reap life everlasting.--We are his workmanship,<br />
 created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before<br />
 ordained that we should walk in them.--Who gave himself for us,<br />
 that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto<br />
 himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<br />
<br />
    We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is<br />
 meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the<br />
 charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.--<br />
 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count<br />
 you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure<br />
 of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power.--It is God<br />
 which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good<br />
 pleasure.<br />

 saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his<br />
 saints, to execute judgment upon all.--Behold, he cometh with<br />
 clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they [also] which<br />
 pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of<br />
 him.<br />
<br />
    The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with<br />
 the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the<br />
 dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive [and]<br />
 remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to<br />
 meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br />

    In Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh<br />
 by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace.<br />

 and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to<br />
 reconcile all things unto himself.--Christ Jesus: whom God hath<br />
 set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to<br />
 declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are<br />
 past, . . . that he might be just, and the justifier of him<br />

 Son to have life in himself.--For as the Father raiseth up the<br />
 dead, and quickeneth [them]; even so the Son quickeneth whom he<br />
 will.<br />
<br />
    I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me,<br />
 though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and<br />
 believeth in me shall never die.--I am the good shepherd: the<br />
 good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.--I lay down my<br />
 life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but<br />
 I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have<br />
 power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my<br />
 Father.--No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.--He that hath<br />
 the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath<br />
 not life.--For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in<br />
 God. When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye<br />
 also appear with him in glory.<br />

              the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<br />
<br />

 Adultery, fornication, . . . and such like: of the which I tell<br />
 you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they<br />
 which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But<br />
 the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,<br />
 gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such<br />
 there is no law. And they that are Christ's have crucified the<br />
 flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit,<br />
 let us also walk in the Spirit.<br />

 that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we<br />

    When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his<br />
 Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that<br />
 were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.<br />
 --The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld<br />
 his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)<br />
 full of grace and truth.--Great is the mystery of godliness: God<br />
 was manifest in the flesh,<br />
<br />
    As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also<br />
 himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he<br />
 might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the<br />
 devil.<br />

<i>Evening</i>:<br />
<br />
         Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.<br />
<br />
    Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Serve the<br />
 LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. . . .<br />
 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, [and] into his courts<br />
 with praise: be thankful unto him, [and] bless his name.--For<br />
 unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the<br />
 government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be<br />
 called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting<br />
 Father, The Prince of Peace.<br />
<br />
    He . . . spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us<br />
 all.--Having yet . . . one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him.<br />
<br />
    Oh that [men] would praise the LORD [for] his goodness, and<br />
 [for] his wonderful works to the children of men!--Bless the<br />
 LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, [bless] his holy<br />
 name.<br />
<br />
    My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in<br />
 God my Saviour.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                   Be ye stedfast, unmoveable,<br />
            always abounding in the work of the Lord.<br />
<br />
    Ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.--As ye<br />
 have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in<br />
 him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as<br />
 ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.--He<br />
 that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.--That<br />
 on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart,<br />
 having heard the word, keep [it], and bring forth fruit with<br />
 patience.<br />
<br />
    By faith ye stand.<br />
<br />
    I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:<br />
 the night cometh, when no man can work.<br />
<br />
    He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap<br />
 corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit<br />
 reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing:<br />
 for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have<br />
 therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially<br />
 unto them who are of the household of faith.<br />

    I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the<br />
 Father, but by me.--Neither is there salvation in any other: for<br />
 there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby<br />
 we must be saved.<br />
<br />
    My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br />
 and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,<br />
 neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand.--He which<br />
 hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
   We look not at the things which are seen,but at the things<br />
    which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are]<br />
   temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.<br />
<br />
    Here have we no continuing city.--Ye have in heaven a better<br />
 and an enduring substance.<br />
<br />
    Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure<br />
 to give you the kingdom.<br />
<br />
    Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through<br />
 manifold temptations.--There the wicked cease [from] troubling;<br />
 and there the weary be at rest.<br />
<br />
    We that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened.--<br />
 God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall<br />
 be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall<br />
 there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.<br />
<br />
    The sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be<br />
 compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.--Our<br />
 light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a<br />
 far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory.<br />

                        He is our peace.<br />

    God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not<br />
 imputing their trespasses unto them; . . . for he hath made him<br />
 [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the<br />
 righteousness of God in him.--Having made peace through the<br />
 blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself;<br />
 by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in<br />
 heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in<br />
 [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the<br />
 body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and<br />
 unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.--Blotting out the<br />
 handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was<br />
 contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his<br />
 cross.--Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law<br />
 of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in<br />
 himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace.<br />
<br />
    Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the<br />
 world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,<br />
 neither let it be afraid.<br />

<i>Morning</i>:<br />
<br />
                   Thy sins be forgiven thee.<br />
<br />
    I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin<br />
 no more.--Who can forgive sins but God only?<br />
<br />
    I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for<br />
 mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.--Blessed [is he<br />
 whose] transgression [is] forgiven, [whose] sin [is] covered.<br />
 Blessed [is] the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity.--<br />
 Who [is] a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity.<br />
<br />
    God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--The blood of Jesus<br />
 Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have<br />
 no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we<br />
 confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our]<br />
 sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br />
<br />
    As far as the east is from the west, [so] far hath he removed<br />
 our transgressions from us.--Sin shall not have dominion over<br />
 you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.--Being then<br />
 made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.<br />

    The LORD [is] nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all<br />
 that call upon him in truth.<br />
<br />
    Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am<br />
 I in the midst of them.--I will not leave you comfortless: I<br />
 will come to you.--Lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end<br />
 of the world.<br />
<br />
    Let us run with patience the race that is set before us,<br />
 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith.<br />
<br />
    Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.--<br />
 Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far<br />
 better.<br />
<br />
    Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet<br />
 appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,<br />
 we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every<br />
 man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is<br />
 pure.<br />

          Understanding what the will of the Lord [is].<br />

 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good<br />
 shall come unto thee.--This is life eternal, that they might<br />
 know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast<br />
 sent.--We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an<br />
 understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in<br />
 him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the<br />
 true God, and eternal life.<br />
<br />
    We . . . do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye<br />
 might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and<br />
 spiritual understanding.--The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the<br />
 Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and<br />
 revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your<br />
 understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the<br />
 hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his<br />
 inheritance in the saints, and what [is] the exceeding greatness<br />
 of his power to us-ward who believe.<br />

    The LORD [is] with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek<br />
 him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will<br />
 forsake you. . . . But when they in their trouble did turn unto<br />
 the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.<br />

    For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the<br />
 LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an<br />
 expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and<br />
 pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me,<br />

 darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the<br />
 light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with<br />
 another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from<br />
 all sin.--He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet,<br />
 but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.<br />
<br />
    I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in<br />
 right paths. When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;<br />
 and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. . . . Enter not<br />
 into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil<br />
 [men]. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.--<br />
 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look<br />
 straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all<br />
 thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the<br />
 left: remove thy foot from evil.<br />

 preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for<br />
 ever and ever. Amen.<br />

<br />
    I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.--In<br />
 his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and<br />
 carried them all the days of old.--As an eagle stirreth up her<br />
 nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings,<br />
 taketh them, beareth them on her wings: [so] the LORD alone did<br />
 lead him.<br />
<br />
    [Even] to [your] old age I [am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs<br />
 will I carry [you]: I have made, and I will bear; even I will<br />
 carry, and will deliver [you].--This God [is] our God for ever<br />
 and ever: he will be our guide [even] unto death.<br />
<br />
    Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he<br />
 shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.--Take no thought<br />
 for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor<br />
 yet for your body, what ye shall put on.--For your heavenly<br />
 Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br />
