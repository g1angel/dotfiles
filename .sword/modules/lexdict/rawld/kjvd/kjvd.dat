(<scripRef>Psalm 35:15-16</scripRef>)

ACQUIT
<i>To hold guiltless.</i><br /><br />The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all <b><font color="#9c1818">ACQUIT</font></b> the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. (<scripRef>Nahum 1:3</scripRef>)

ADAMANT
<i>An extremely hard substance.</i><br /><br />But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

(<scripRef>Ezekiel 3:7-9</scripRef>)

ADDER
<i>A venomous snake.</i><br /><br />The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

(<scripRef>Psalm 58:3-5</scripRef>)

ADJURE

And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and <b><font color="#9c1818">ADMONITION</font></b> of the Lord. (<scripRef>Ephesians 6:1-4</scripRef>)

ADO
<i>Fuss; bother; tumult.</i><br /><br />And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

(<scripRef>1 Kings 3:1</scripRef>)

AFOOT

And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. (<scripRef>Acts 20:13-14</scripRef>)

AFRESH
<i>Again; anew.</i><br /><br />For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God <b><font color="#9c1818">AFRESH</font></b>, and put him to an open shame. (<scripRef>Hebrews 6:4-6</scripRef>)

AGAR

For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.

<i>A fever.</i><br /><br />I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning <b><font color="#9c1818">AGUE</font></b>, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

<i>Even though; although.</i><br /><br />Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; <b><font color="#9c1818">ALBEIT</font></b> I have not spoken?

ALMS
<i>Acts and deeds of mercy.</i><br /><br />But when thou doest <b><font color="#9c1818">ALMS</font></b>, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine <b><font color="#9c1818">ALMS</font></b> may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:3-4</scripRef>)

ALOOF
<i>At a distance, but within view.</i><br /><br />Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

AMBASSAGE

(<scripRef>Revelation 3:14-15</scripRef>)

ANATHEMA
<i>An accursed thing.</i><br /><br />If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <b><font color="#9c1818">ANATHEMA</font></b> Maranatha. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 16:22</scripRef>)

ANOINT
<i>To rub in; rub on.</i><br /><br />Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and <b><font color="#9c1818">ANOINT</font></b> thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. (<scripRef>Revelation 3:17-18</scripRef>)

ANON
<i>Immediately.</i><br /><br />But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and <b><font color="#9c1818">ANON</font></b> with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. (<scripRef>Matthew 13:20</scripRef>)

ANTICHRIST
<i>One opposed to Christ.</i><br /><br />Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that <b><font color="#9c1818">ANTICHRIST</font></b> shall come, even now are there many <b><font color="#9c1818">ANTICHRIST</font></b>S; whereby we know that it is the last time. (<scripRef>1 John 2:18</scripRef>)

APACE
<i>At a quick pace; quickly.</i><br /><br />Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? And their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled <b><font color="#9c1818">APACE</font></b>, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.

APOSTLE
<i>Messenger; one who has been sent.</i><br /><br />But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the <b><font color="#9c1818">APOSTLE</font></b>S of our Lord Jesus Christ;  How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

ARK
<i>Box; chest.</i><br /><br />And they shall make an <b><font color="#9c1818">ARK</font></b> of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. (<scripRef>Exodus 25:10</scripRef>)

ARMHOLES
<i>Armpits.</i><br /><br />So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine <b><font color="#9c1818">ARMHOLES</font></b> under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 38:11-13</scripRef>)

ARRAY
<i>To put on; to clothe.</i><br /><br />Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?   And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not <b><font color="#9c1818">ARRAY</font></b>ED like one of these. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:27-29</scripRef>)

ASP
<i>A snake, serpent.</i><br /><br />And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the <b><font color="#9c1818">ASP</font></b>, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put <b><font color="#9c1818">ASUNDER</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 19:4-6</scripRef>)

And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an <b><font color="#9c1818">AUSTERE</font></b> man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:  Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? (<scripRef>Luke 19:20-23</scripRef>)

AVERSE
<i>To turn away from.</i><br /><br />Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men <b><font color="#9c1818">AVERSE</font></b> from war.  The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. (<scripRef>Micah 2:8-9</scripRef>)

BACKBITINGS
<i>Evil speakings; slanders.</i><br /><br />For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, <b><font color="#9c1818">BACKBITINGS</font></b>, whisperings, swellings, tumults. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 12:20</scripRef>)

(<scripRef>Genesis 40:16-17</scripRef>)

<i>Was exactly suited for; was fitting.</i><br /><br />But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

For such an high priest <b><font color="#9c1818">BECAME</font></b> us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens. (<scripRef>Hebrews 7:24-26</scripRef>)

BEGUILE
<i>To deceive; lead astray.</i><br /><br />And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

(<scripRef>Luke 24:45-47</scripRef>)

BELIED
<i>To lie against; to speak falsely.</i><br /><br />For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.  They have <b><font color="#9c1818">BELIED</font></b> the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 5:11-12</scripRef>)

BERYL
<i>A precious stone.</i><br /><br />Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: his body also was like the <b><font color="#9c1818">BERYL</font></b>, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

BESOM
<i>A broom or sweep.</i><br /><br />For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.

(<scripRef>Isaiah 14:22-23</scripRef>)

BESOUGHT
<i>Entreated; asked; called.</i><br /><br />For this thing I <b><font color="#9c1818">BESOUGHT</font></b> the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 12:8-9</scripRef>)

BESTEAD
<i>Hard pressed; oppressed.</i><br /><br />And they shall pass through it, hardly <b><font color="#9c1818">BESTEAD</font></b> and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. (<scripRef>Isaiah 8:21</scripRef>)

<i>"Lay it to heart"; consider and repent.</i><br /><br />If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; yet if they <b><font color="#9c1818">BETHINK</font></b> themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly...then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. (<scripRef>2 Chronicles 6:36-39</scripRef>)

BEWRAY
<i>To make manifest, clear, evident.</i><br /><br />And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech <b><font color="#9c1818">BEWRAY</font></b>ETH thee.  Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. (<scripRef>Matthew 26:72-74</scripRef>)

BIER
<i>Device on which dead bodies were placed.</i><br /><br />And he came and touched the <b><font color="#9c1818">BIER</font></b>: and they that bare him stood still.

BISHOP
<i>An overseer.</i><br /><br />This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a <b><font color="#9c1818">BISHOP</font></b>, he desireth a good work.  A <b><font color="#9c1818">BISHOP</font></b> then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:1</scripRef>)

BISHOPRIC
<i>Guardianship; office of overseeing.</i><br /><br />Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.  And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.  For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his <b><font color="#9c1818">BISHOPRIC</font></b> let another take. (<scripRef>Acts 1:18-20</scripRef>)

BLAINS
<i>Inflamed skin tumors.</i><br /><br />And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

(<scripRef>Exodus 9:8-9</scripRef>)

<i>Happy.</i><br /><br /><b><font color="#9c1818">BLESSED</font></b> is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. (<scripRef>Psalm 1:1-2</scripRef>)

BOISTEROUS
<i>Strong; mighty; powerful.</i><br /><br />And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

BOLLED
<i>Blossomed; in the seed/pod.</i><br /><br />And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was <b><font color="#9c1818">BOLLED</font></b>.  But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. (<scripRef>Exodus 9:31-32</scripRef>)

BOLSTER

BOSSES
<i>Circular swelling, mid-part of a shield.</i><br /><br />The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.  Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.  For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.  He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick <b><font color="#9c1818">BOSSES</font></b> of his bucklers: because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks. (<scripRef>Job 15:27</scripRef>)

BOTCH
<i>An ulcer.</i><br /><br />The LORD will smite thee with the <b><font color="#9c1818">BOTCH</font></b> of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. (<scripRef>Deuteronomy 28:27</scripRef>)

BOUND
<i>Landmark.</i><br /><br />The princes of Judah were like them that remove the <b><font color="#9c1818">BOUND</font></b>: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. (<scripRef>Hosea 5:10</scripRef>)

BOWELS
<i>Inward parts; affections.</i><br /><br />Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, <b><font color="#9c1818">BOWELS</font></b> of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering. (<scripRef>Colossians 3:12</scripRef>)

BRAVERY
<i>Beauty; splendor.</i><br /><br />In that day the Lord will take away the <b><font color="#9c1818">BRAVERY</font></b> of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings. (<scripRef>Isaiah 3:18-20</scripRef>)

BRAWLER
<i>One who is inclined to fight.</i><br /><br />A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a <b><font color="#9c1818">BRAWLER</font></b>, not covetous. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:2-3</scripRef>)

BRAY
<i>To crush as in a mortar.</i><br /><br />Though thou shouldest <b><font color="#9c1818">BRAY</font></b> a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. (<scripRef>Proverbs 27:22</scripRef>)

BRAYED
<i>To groan, wail; make a foul noise.</i><br /><br />Among the bushes they <b><font color="#9c1818">BRAYED</font></b>; under the nettles they were gathered together.  They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. (<scripRef>Job 30:7</scripRef>)

BREACHES
<i>Bays; harbors; creeks.</i><br /><br />Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his <b><font color="#9c1818">BREACHES</font></b>. (<scripRef>Judges 5:17</scripRef>)

BREECHES
<i>Trousers.</i><br /><br />They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen <b><font color="#9c1818">BREECHES</font></b> upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 44:18</scripRef>)

BRIGANDINE
<i>A coat of armor.</i><br /><br />Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the <b><font color="#9c1818">BRIGANDINE</font></b>S. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 46:3-4</scripRef>)

BRIMSTONE
<i>Sulphur.</i><br /><br />The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.  Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and <b><font color="#9c1818">BRIMSTONE</font></b>, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. (<scripRef>Psalm 11:6</scripRef>)

BROIDED
<i>Twined; braided.</i><br /><br />In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with <b><font color="#9c1818">BROIDED</font></b> hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 2:9</scripRef>)

BROOD
<i>A group of young animals.</i><br /><br />O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her <b><font color="#9c1818">BROOD</font></b> under her wings, and ye would not! (<scripRef>Luke 13:34</scripRef>)

BRUIT
<i>News; a rumor; a report.</i><br /><br />Behold, the noise of the <b><font color="#9c1818">BRUIT</font></b> is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 10:22</scripRef>)

BRUTISH
<i>Stupid.</i><br /><br />Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is <b><font color="#9c1818">BRUTISH</font></b>. (<scripRef>Proverbs 12:1</scripRef>)

BUCKLER
<i>A shield.</i><br /><br />The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my <b><font color="#9c1818">BUCKLER</font></b>, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.  I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. (<scripRef>Psalm 18:2-3</scripRef>)

BUFFET
<i>To strike with a clenched fist.</i><br /><br />What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. Then did they spit in his face, and <b><font color="#9c1818">BUFFET</font></b>ED him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? (<scripRef>Matthew 26:66-68</scripRef>)

BULLOCK
<i>Bull; steer; ox.</i><br /><br />I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.  This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or <b><font color="#9c1818">BULLOCK</font></b> that hath horns and hoofs. (<scripRef>Psalm 69:30-31</scripRef>)

BULWARK
<i>A defensive structure.</i><br /><br />Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.  Mark ye well her <b><font color="#9c1818">BULWARK</font></b>S, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. (<scripRef>Psalm 48:12-13</scripRef>)

BUTTOCKS
<i>The seat; the posteriors; the rear end.</i><br /><br />And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their <b><font color="#9c1818">BUTTOCKS</font></b> uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

(<scripRef>Jeremiah 52:17-18</scripRef>)

CALKERS
<i>Repairers of seams.</i><br /><br />The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

(<scripRef>Ezekiel 27:8-9</scripRef>)

CANDLESTICK
<i>Lampstand.</i><br /><br />And thou shalt make a <b><font color="#9c1818">CANDLESTICK</font></b> of pure gold: of beaten work shall the <b><font color="#9c1818">CANDLESTICK</font></b> be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same. (<scripRef>Exodus 25:31</scripRef>)

CANKER
<i>A dying or decay of a part of the body.</i><br /><br />But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.  And their word will eat as doth a <b><font color="#9c1818">CANKER</font></b>: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus. (<scripRef>2 Timothy 2:16-17</scripRef>)

CARNAL
<i>Of the flesh; denoting human nature.</i><br /><br />For ye are yet <b><font color="#9c1818">CARNAL</font></b>: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not <b><font color="#9c1818">CARNAL</font></b>, and walk as men? (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 3:3</scripRef>)

CARRIAGES

(<scripRef>Acts 21:13-15</scripRef>)

(<scripRef>Isaiah 19:7-8</scripRef>)

CAUL

(<scripRef>Acts 10:1-2</scripRef>)

CHAMBERING
<i>Sexual immorality; lewdness.</i><br /><br />The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

<i>An "up-rising", hence sunrising.</i><br /><br />And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the <b><font color="#9c1818">DAYSPRING</font></b> from on high hath visited us,  To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. (<scripRef>Luke 1:76-79</scripRef>)

DEACON
<i>Servant; attendant.</i><br /><br />Likewise must the <b><font color="#9c1818">DEACON</font></b>S be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:8</scripRef>)

DEARTH
<i>A cutting off of rain.</i><br /><br />The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the <b><font color="#9c1818">DEARTH</font></b>.  Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.  Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 14:1-4</scripRef>)

DEFAME
<i>To slander; speak evil of.</i><br /><br />Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being <b><font color="#9c1818">DEFAME</font></b>D, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 4:11-13</scripRef>)

DEFER
<i>To delay; postpone.</i><br /><br />Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.  For my name's sake will I <b><font color="#9c1818">DEFER</font></b> mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. (<scripRef>Isaiah 48:8-10</scripRef>)

DEGENERATE
<i>Having fallen from a desirable state.</i><br /><br />Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the <b><font color="#9c1818">DEGENERATE</font></b> plant of a strange vine unto me? (<scripRef>Jeremiah 2:21</scripRef>)

DERISION
<i>Ridicule; laughing at enemies' threats.</i><br /><br />The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in <b><font color="#9c1818">DERISION</font></b>. (<scripRef>Psalm 2:2-4</scripRef>)

DESCRY
<i>To spy out.</i><br /><br />And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.  And the house of Joseph sent to <b><font color="#9c1818">DESCRY</font></b> Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy. (<scripRef>Judges 1:22-23</scripRef>)

DESPITE
<i>Contempt.</i><br /><br />For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy <b><font color="#9c1818">DESPITE</font></b> against the land of Israel; behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 25:6-7</scripRef>)

DESTITUTE
<i>Those whose souls have been laid bare.</i><br /><br />When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.  He will regard the prayer of the <b><font color="#9c1818">DESTITUTE</font></b>, and not despise their prayer. (<scripRef>Psalm 102:16-17</scripRef>)

DEVIL
<i>Slanderer; false accuser.</i><br /><br />Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a <b><font color="#9c1818">DEVIL</font></b>?  He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. (<scripRef>John 6:70-71</scripRef>)

DEVIL, HATH A
<i>Aramaic idiom: "is crazy, insane".</i><br /><br />For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He HATH A DEVIL.  The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! (<scripRef>Luke 7:33-34</scripRef>)

DIADEM
<i>Turban; crown.</i><br /><br />I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a <b><font color="#9c1818">DIADEM</font></b>. (<scripRef>Job 29:14</scripRef>)

DIE THE DEATH
<i>"Surely die".</i><br /><br />For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him <b><font color="#9c1818">DIE THE DEATH</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 15:4</scripRef>)

DISALLOWED
<i>Rejected.</i><br /><br />Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders <b><font color="#9c1818">DISALLOWED</font></b>, the same is made the head of the corner. (<scripRef>1 Peter 2:2-4</scripRef>)

DISANNUL
<i>To abolish a vow; to break.</i><br /><br />This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.  For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall <b><font color="#9c1818">DISANNUL</font></b> it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? (<scripRef>Isaiah 14:27</scripRef>)

DISCERN
<i>To examine, prove or test; scrutinize.</i><br /><br />And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.  And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.  Ye hypocrites, ye can <b><font color="#9c1818">DISCERN</font></b> the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not <b><font color="#9c1818">DISCERN</font></b> this time? (<scripRef>Luke 12:54-56</scripRef>)

DISCOMFIT
<i>To disturb.</i><br /><br />The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and <b><font color="#9c1818">DISCOMFIT</font></b>ED them. (<scripRef>Psalm 18:13-14</scripRef>)

DISDAIN
<i>To reject; to despise.</i><br /><br />But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have <b><font color="#9c1818">DISDAIN</font></b>ED to have set with the dogs of my flock. (<scripRef>Job 30:1</scripRef>)

DISPENSATION
<i>An arrangement of things; a scheme.</i><br /><br />Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that in the <b><font color="#9c1818">DISPENSATION</font></b> of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him. (<scripRef>Ephesians 1:9-10</scripRef>)

DISSEMBLE
<i>To use deceit; to feign.</i><br /><br />The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.  For ye <b><font color="#9c1818">DISSEMBLE</font></b>D in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.  And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 42:19-21</scripRef>)

DISSEMBLERS
<i>Pretenders; hypocrites.</i><br /><br />Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.  I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with <b><font color="#9c1818">DISSEMBLERS</font></b>.  I have hated the congregation of evildoers; and will not sit with the wicked. (<scripRef>Psalm 26:2-5</scripRef>)

DISSEMBLETH
<i>To pretend; to use deceit.</i><br /><br />He that hateth <b><font color="#9c1818">DISSEMBLETH</font></b> with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; when he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. (<scripRef>Proverbs 26:24-25</scripRef>)

DISSIMULATION
<i>Hypocrisy.</i><br /><br />And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their <b><font color="#9c1818">DISSIMULATION</font></b>. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? (<scripRef>Galatians 2:13-14</scripRef>)

DIVERS
<i>Different; unequal; various.</i><br /><br /><b><font color="#9c1818">DIVERS</font></b> weights, and <b><font color="#9c1818">DIVERS</font></b> measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. (<scripRef>Proverbs 20:10</scripRef>)

DIVERS
<i>Some ones; certain ones.</i><br /><br />And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.  But when <b><font color="#9c1818">DIVERS </font></b>were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. (<scripRef>Acts 19:8-9</scripRef>)

DOCTOR
<i>Teacher; instructor.</i><br /><br />And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the <b><font color="#9c1818">DOCTOR</font></b>S, both hearing them, and asking them questions. (<scripRef>Luke 2:46</scripRef>)

DOCTRINE
<i>The act or result of teaching.</i><br /><br />For the time will come when they will not endure sound <b><font color="#9c1818">DOCTRINE</font></b>; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. (<scripRef>2 Timothy 4:3-4</scripRef>)

DOLEFUL
<i>Howling; shrieking.</i><br /><br />But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of <b><font color="#9c1818">DOLEFUL</font></b> creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. (<scripRef>Isaiah 13:21</scripRef>)

DOTE
<i>To become foolish.</i><br /><br />A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.  A sword is upon the liars; and they shall <b><font color="#9c1818">DOTE</font></b>: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 50:35-36</scripRef>)

DOTH
<i>To do; to produce; make.</i><br /><br />Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust <b><font color="#9c1818">DOTH</font></b> corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust <b><font color="#9c1818">DOTH</font></b> corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:19-20</scripRef>)

DOTING
<i>To appear to be ill, or sick over.</i><br /><br />If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;  He is proud, knowing nothing, but <b><font color="#9c1818">DOTING</font></b> about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 6:3-4</scripRef>)

DRAGON
<i>Jackal; wild dog.</i><br /><br />And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for <b><font color="#9c1818">DRAGON</font></b>S, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 51:37</scripRef>)

DRAUGHT
<i>Latrine; toilet.</i><br /><br />And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the <b><font color="#9c1818">DRAUGHT</font></b>, purging all meats? (<scripRef>Mark 7:19</scripRef>)

DRAUGHT
<i>A catching, hunting.</i><br /><br />For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the <b><font color="#9c1818">DRAUGHT </font></b>of the fishes which they had taken: And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. (<scripRef>Luke 5:9-10</scripRef>)

DRAVE
<i>Drove; had driven.</i><br /><br />And took off their chariot wheels, that they <b><font color="#9c1818">DRAVE</font></b> them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. (<scripRef>Exodus 14:25</scripRef>)

DREGS
<i>Sediment.</i><br /><br />Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the <b><font color="#9c1818">DREGS</font></b> of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out. (<scripRef>Isaiah 51:17</scripRef>)

DROMEDARY
<i>A camel, or steed.</i><br /><br />Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the DROMEDARIES of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. (<scripRef>Isaiah 60:5-7</scripRef>)

DROPSY
<i>An illness.</i><br /><br />And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.  And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the <b><font color="#9c1818">DROPSY</font></b>.  And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? (<scripRef>Luke 14:1-3</scripRef>)

DROSS
<i>Waste formed by melting metal.</i><br /><br />Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become <b><font color="#9c1818">DROSS</font></b>: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the <b><font color="#9c1818">DROSS</font></b> of silver.  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become <b><font color="#9c1818">DROSS</font></b>, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 22:18-19</scripRef>)

DROVE
<i>Flock; company.</i><br /><br />Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.  And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every <b><font color="#9c1818">DROVE</font></b> by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt <b><font color="#9c1818">DROVE</font></b> and <b><font color="#9c1818">DROVE</font></b>. (<scripRef>Genesis 32:15-16</scripRef>)

DRYSHOD
<i>Footed with shoes.</i><br /><br />And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over <b><font color="#9c1818">DRYSHOD</font></b>.  And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. (<scripRef>Isaiah 11:15-16</scripRef>)

DUKE
<i>A head of a family or tribe.</i><br /><br />These were <b><font color="#9c1818">DUKE</font></b>S of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; <b><font color="#9c1818">DUKE</font></b> Teman, <b><font color="#9c1818">DUKE</font></b> Omar, <b><font color="#9c1818">DUKE</font></b> Zepho, <b><font color="#9c1818">DUKE</font></b> Kenaz. (<scripRef>Genesis 36:15</scripRef>)

DURETH
<i>Endures; lasts.</i><br /><br />But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  Yet hath he not root in himself, but <b><font color="#9c1818">DURETH</font></b> for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. (<scripRef>Matthew 13:20-21</scripRef>)

DURST
<i>To dare; venture.</i><br /><br />Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.  Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.   And after that they <b><font color="#9c1818">DURST</font></b> not ask him any question at all. (<scripRef>Luke 20:37-40</scripRef>)

EAR
<i>To work, till, or plough the ground.</i><br /><br />The oxen likewise and the young asses that <b><font color="#9c1818">EAR</font></b> the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. (<scripRef>Isaiah 30:24</scripRef>)

EARING

EARNEST
<i>A pledge.</i><br /><br />Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the <b><font color="#9c1818">EARNEST</font></b> of the Spirit in our hearts. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 1:21-22</scripRef>)

<i>Older; greater in age.</i><br /><br />Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were <b><font color="#9c1818">ELDER</font></b> than he. (<scripRef>Job 32:4</scripRef>)

ELIAS
<i>Elijah.</i><br /><br />And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for <b><font color="#9c1818">ELIAS</font></b>. (<scripRef>Mark 9:5</scripRef>)

EMERODS
<i>Tumors; hemorrhoids.</i><br /><br />But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with <b><font color="#9c1818">EMERODS</font></b>, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. (<scripRef>1 Samuel 5:6</scripRef>)

EMINENT
<i>Something raised up high.</i><br /><br />And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine <b><font color="#9c1818">EMINENT</font></b> place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.  They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 16:39-40</scripRef>)

<i>Jealousy.</i><br /><br />Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, <b><font color="#9c1818">EMULATION</font></b>S, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (<scripRef>Galatians 5:19-21</scripRef>)

ENGINE
<i>Warlike invention.</i><br /><br />And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.  And he made in Jerusalem <b><font color="#9c1818">ENGINE</font></b>s, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. (<scripRef>2 Chronicles 26:14-15</scripRef>)

ENJOIN
<i>To command; charge.</i><br /><br />For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath <b><font color="#9c1818">ENJOIN</font></b>ED unto you. (<scripRef>Hebrews 9:19-20</scripRef>)

(<scripRef>Genesis 3:14-15</scripRef>)

ENSAMPLE
<i>An example.</i><br /><br />And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: So that ye were <b><font color="#9c1818">ENSAMPLE</font></b>S to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. (<scripRef>1 Thessalonians 1:7-8</scripRef>)

ENSUE
<i>To pursue after.</i><br /><br />For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and <b><font color="#9c1818">ENSUE</font></b> it. (<scripRef>1 Peter 3:10-11</scripRef>)

ENTREAT
<i>To treat; use.</i><br /><br />And the next day we touched at Sidon.

And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. (<scripRef>Acts 27:3-4</scripRef>)

ENTREAT
<i>To comfort; attempt to reconcile; help.</i><br /><br />Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:  Being defamed, we ENTREAT: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 4:11-13</scripRef>)

ENTREATIES
<i>Pleadings; humble requests.</i><br /><br />The poor useth <b><font color="#9c1818">ENTREATIES</font></b>; but the rich answereth roughly. (<scripRef>Proverbs 18:23</scripRef>)

ENVIRON
<i>To surround; compass.</i><br /><br />For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall <b><font color="#9c1818">ENVIRON</font></b> us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? (<scripRef>Joshua 7:9</scripRef>)

EQUITY
<i>Uprightness.</i><br /><br />But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with <b><font color="#9c1818">EQUITY</font></b> for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. (<scripRef>Isaiah 11:4</scripRef>)

ERE
<i>Before.</i><br /><br />How long will it be <b><font color="#9c1818">ERE</font></b> ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak. (<scripRef>Job 18:2</scripRef>)

ESAIAS
<i>Isaiah.</i><br /><br />Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet <b><font color="#9c1818">ESAIAS</font></b>. (<scripRef>John 1:23</scripRef>)

ESCHEW
<i>To avoid; turn aside from.</i><br /><br />For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: let him <b><font color="#9c1818">ESCHEW</font></b> evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. (<scripRef>1 Peter 3:10-11</scripRef>)

ESPOUSED
<i>To be asked in marriage.</i><br /><br />Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was <b><font color="#9c1818">ESPOUSED</font></b> to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. (<scripRef>Matthew 1:18</scripRef>)

ESPY
<i>To see; behold.</i><br /><br />And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he ESPIED his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.  And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? (<scripRef>Genesis 42:27-28</scripRef>)

ESTRANGED
<i>To be a stranger.</i><br /><br />Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.  The wicked are <b><font color="#9c1818">ESTRANGED</font></b> from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. (<scripRef>Psalm 58:2-3</scripRef>)

EUROCLYDON
<i>A furious, north-easterly wind.</i><br /><br />And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.  But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called <b><font color="#9c1818">EUROCLYDON</font></b>. (<scripRef>Acts 27:13-14</scripRef>)

EVANGELIST
<i>Messenger of good tidings.</i><br /><br />But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an <b><font color="#9c1818">EVANGELIST</font></b>, make full proof of thy ministry. (<scripRef>2 Timothy 4:5</scripRef>)

EVENINGTIDE
<i>Evening time.</i><br /><br />And behold at <b><font color="#9c1818">EVENINGTIDE</font></b> trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us. (<scripRef>Isaiah 17:14</scripRef>)

EVENTIDE
<i>Evening time.</i><br /><br />And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the <b><font color="#9c1818">EVENTIDE</font></b> was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. (<scripRef>Mark 11:11</scripRef>)

EVERY SEVERAL
<i>Each individual; each one separately.</i><br /><br />And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: <b><font color="#9c1818">EVERY SEVERAL</font></b> gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. (<scripRef>Revelation 21:19-21</scripRef>)

EVERY WHIT
<i>Whole; all.</i><br /><br />Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.  Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean <b><font color="#9c1818">EVERY WHIT</font></b>: and ye are clean, but not all. (<scripRef>John 13:6-10</scripRef>)

EXACTOR
<i>Overseer.</i><br /><br />Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine <b><font color="#9c1818">EXACTOR</font></b>S righteousness.  Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. (<scripRef>Isaiah 60:16-18</scripRef>)

EXECRATION
<i>A curse.</i><br /><br />So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.  For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an <b><font color="#9c1818">EXECRATION</font></b>, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 42:17-18</scripRef>)

EXHORTATION
<i>Encouragement.</i><br /><br />For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.  But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and <b><font color="#9c1818">EXHORTATION</font></b>, and comfort. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 14:2-3</scripRef>)

EXPOUND
<i>To set forth; to declare.</i><br /><br />This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and <b><font color="#9c1818">EXPOUND</font></b>ED unto him the way of God more perfectly. (<scripRef>Acts 18:25-26</scripRef>)

EXTOL
<i>To lift up; esteem; praise.</i><br /><br />David's Psalm of praise.  I will <b><font color="#9c1818">EXTOL</font></b> thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.  Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. (<scripRef>Psalm 145:1-2</scripRef>)

EXTORTIONER
<i>A greedy, ravenous person.</i><br /><br />Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, EXTORNIONERS, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. (<scripRef>Luke 18:10-11</scripRef>)

EYESALVE
<i>Medicine for the eyes.</i><br /><br />I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with <b><font color="#9c1818">EYESALVE</font></b>, that thou mayest see. (<scripRef>Revelation 3:18</scripRef>)

EYESERVICE
<i>Only while being watched.</i><br /><br />Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with <b><font color="#9c1818">EYESERVICE</font></b>, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. (<scripRef>Ephesians 6:5-8</scripRef>)

FAIN
<i>To desire earnestly; long for.</i><br /><br />And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.  And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.  And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would <b><font color="#9c1818">FAIN</font></b> have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. (<scripRef>Luke 15:13-16</scripRef>)

FAMILIARS
<i>Intimate friends.</i><br /><br />For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it.  All my <b><font color="#9c1818">FAMILIARS</font></b> watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 20:10</scripRef>)

FAMISHED
<i>To have suffered hunger.</i><br /><br />Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are <b><font color="#9c1818">FAMISHED</font></b>, and their multitude dried up with thirst. (<scripRef>Isaiah 5:13</scripRef>)

FAN
<i>An agricultural tool; winnowing shovel.</i><br /><br />I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: Whose <b><font color="#9c1818">FAN</font></b> is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. (<scripRef>Matthew 3:11-12</scripRef>)

FARE
<i>To make merry; rejoice.</i><br /><br />There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and <b><font color="#9c1818">FARE</font></b>D sumptuously every day: and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. (<scripRef>Luke 16:19-21</scripRef>)

FARTHING
<i>A small coin of little worth.</i><br /><br />Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost <b><font color="#9c1818">FARTHING</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:25-26</scripRef>)

FAST
<i>Abstaining from food.</i><br /><br />Moreover when ye <b><font color="#9c1818">FAST</font></b>, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to <b><font color="#9c1818">FAST</font></b>.  Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou <b><font color="#9c1818">FAST</font></b>EST, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to <b><font color="#9c1818">FAST</font></b>, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:16-18</scripRef>)

FATHOM
<i>Approx. 6 feet.</i><br /><br />But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  And sounded, and found it twenty <b><font color="#9c1818">FATHOM</font></b>s: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen <b><font color="#9c1818">FATHOM</font></b>S. (<scripRef>Acts 27:27-28</scripRef>)

FATLING
<i>Fat cattle.</i><br /><br />The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the <b><font color="#9c1818">FATLING</font></b> together; and a little child shall lead them. (<scripRef>Isaiah 11:6</scripRef>)

FEIGN
<i>To pretend.</i><br /><br />And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.  And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should <b><font color="#9c1818">FEIGN</font></b> themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. (<scripRef>Luke 20:19-20</scripRef>)

FEIGNED
<i>Deceitful; false.</i><br /><br />A prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of <b><font color="#9c1818">FEIGNED</font></b> lips. (<scripRef>Psalm 17:1</scripRef>)

FELLER
<i>One who cuts down.</i><br /><br />The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.  Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no <b><font color="#9c1818">FELLER</font></b> is come up against us. (<scripRef>Isaiah 14:7-8</scripRef>)

FEN
<i>Marsh; swamp.</i><br /><br />Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and <b><font color="#9c1818">FEN</font></b>S. (<scripRef>Job 40:15,21</scripRef>)

FENCED
<i>Fortified; protected.</i><br /><br />But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the <b><font color="#9c1818">FENCED</font></b> cities because of the inhabitants of the land. (<scripRef>Numbers 32:17</scripRef>)

FETCHED A COMPASS
<i>Made a circuit; wandered up and down.</i><br /><br />And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. And from thence we <b><font color="#9c1818">FETCHED A COMPASS</font></b>, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli. (<scripRef>Acts 28:12-13</scripRef>)

FETTERS
<i>Bonds; chains.</i><br /><br />He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:  Whose feet they hurt with <b><font color="#9c1818">FETTERS</font></b>: he was laid in iron:  Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.  The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. (<scripRef>Psalm 105:17-20</scripRef>)

FILLETS
<i>Curtain rods placed between columns.</i><br /><br />And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their <b><font color="#9c1818">FILLETS</font></b> shall be of silver. (<scripRef>Exodus 27:10</scripRef>)

FINING
<i>Refining.</i><br /><br />The <b><font color="#9c1818">FINING</font></b> pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. (<scripRef>Proverbs 17:3</scripRef>)

FIREBRAND
<i>Firewood; torch.</i><br /><br />And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking <b><font color="#9c1818">FIREBRAND</font></b>S, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. (<scripRef>Isaiah 7:4</scripRef>)

FIRKIN
<i>Liquid measurement.</i><br /><br />And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRKIN</font></b>S apiece.  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. (<scripRef>John 2:6-7</scripRef>)

FIRMAMENT
<i>Expanse or vault over the earth; sky.</i><br /><br />And God said, Let there be a <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRMAMENT</font></b> in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  And God made the <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRMAMENT</font></b>, and divided the waters which were under the <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRMAMENT</font></b> from the waters which were above the <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRMAMENT</font></b>: and it was so.  And God called the <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRMAMENT</font></b> Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. (<scripRef>Genesis 1:6-8</scripRef>)

FIRSTLING
<i>First offspring.</i><br /><br />And Abel, he also brought of the <b><font color="#9c1818">FIRSTLING</font></b>S of his flock and of the fat thereof.  And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering. (<scripRef>Genesis 4:4</scripRef>)

FITCHES
<i>A species of grain.</i><br /><br />For the <b><font color="#9c1818">FITCHES</font></b> are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the <b><font color="#9c1818">FITCHES</font></b> are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. (<scripRef>Isaiah 28:27</scripRef>)

FLAG
<i>Type of marsh grass or reed</i><br /><br />Can the rush grow up without mire? can the <b><font color="#9c1818">FLAG</font></b> grow without water?  Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.  So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish. (<scripRef>Job 8:11-13</scripRef>)

FLAGON
<i>Bottle; vessel.</i><br /><br />Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love <b><font color="#9c1818">FLAGON</font></b>S of wine. (<scripRef>Hosea 3:1</scripRef>)

FLAGS
<i>A plant growing in moist places.</i><br /><br />And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.  And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and <b><font color="#9c1818">FLAGS</font></b> shall wither. (<scripRef>Isaiah 19:5-6</scripRef>)

FLAY
<i>To strip.</i><br /><br />And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;  Who also eat the flesh of my people, and <b><font color="#9c1818">FLAY</font></b> their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. (<scripRef>Micah 3:1-3</scripRef>)

FLOWERS
<i>Menstrual flow, blood.</i><br /><br />And if any man lie with her at all, and her <b><font color="#9c1818">FLOWERS</font></b> be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. (<scripRef>Leviticus 15:24</scripRef>)

FLUX
<i>An intestinal disease; dysentery.</i><br /><br />And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody <b><font color="#9c1818">FLUX</font></b>: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. (<scripRef>Acts 28:8</scripRef>)

FOLDEN
<i>Interwoven; tangled.</i><br /><br />For while they be <b><font color="#9c1818">FOLDEN</font></b> together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry. (<scripRef>Nahum 1:10</scripRef>)

FORBEAR
<i>To cease; to let alone; to be silent.</i><br /><br />Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I <b><font color="#9c1818">FORBEAR</font></b>, what am I eased? (<scripRef>Job 16:6</scripRef>)

FORBEARANCE
<i>Self-restraint.</i><br /><br />And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and <b><font color="#9c1818">FORBEARANCE</font></b> and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? (<scripRef>Romans 2:3-4</scripRef>)

FORBEARING
<i>Patience; slow anger.</i><br /><br />By long <b><font color="#9c1818">FORBEARING</font></b> is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. (<scripRef>Proverbs 25:15</scripRef>)

FORBORNE
<i>Ceased.</i><br /><br />The mighty men of Babylon have <b><font color="#9c1818">FORBORNE</font></b> to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 51:30</scripRef>)

FORD
<i>Where a river can be crossed by foot.</i><br /><br />For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the <b><font color="#9c1818">FORD</font></b>S of Arnon. (<scripRef>Isaiah 16:2</scripRef>)

FORESAW
<i>Beheld.</i><br /><br />Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. For David speaketh concerning him, I <b><font color="#9c1818">FORESAW</font></b> the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. (<scripRef>Acts 2:24-25</scripRef>)

FORNICATION
<i>Sexual immorality.</i><br /><br />Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  But <b><font color="#9c1818">FORNICATION</font></b>, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. (<scripRef>Ephesian 5:1-4</scripRef>)

FORSAKEN
<i>To leave in an abandoned condition.</i><br /><br />My God, my God, why hast thou <b><font color="#9c1818">FORSAKEN</font></b> me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. (<scripRef>Psalm 22:1-2</scripRef>)

FORSOOK
<i>To have left in an abandoned condition.</i><br /><br />And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.  And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. And when they had brought their ships to land, they <b><font color="#9c1818">FORSOOK</font></b> all, and followed him. (<scripRef>Luke 5:10-11</scripRef>)

FORSWEAR
<i>To swear falsely.</i><br /><br />Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not <b><font color="#9c1818">FORSWEAR</font></b> thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:33</scripRef>)

FORTHWITH
<i>Immediately.</i><br /><br />And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and <b><font color="#9c1818">FORTHWITH</font></b> they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. (<scripRef>Matthew 13:4-6</scripRef>)

FORWARD, TO BE
<i>To wish; to desire; to purpose.</i><br /><br />And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be FORWARD a year ago.  Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 8:10-11</scripRef>)

FOURSCORE
<i>Eighty.</i><br /><br />The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be <b><font color="#9c1818">FOURSCORE</font></b> years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. (<scripRef>Psalm 90:10</scripRef>)

FOURSQUARE
<i>Squared; four cornered.</i><br /><br />So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, <b><font color="#9c1818">FOURSQUARE</font></b>; and the altar that was before the house. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 40:47</scripRef>)

FOWLER
<i>One who snares birds.</i><br /><br />I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.  Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the <b><font color="#9c1818">FOWLER</font></b>, and from the noisome pestilence. (<scripRef>Psalm 91:2-3</scripRef>)

FOWLS
<i>Birds.</i><br /><br />Behold the <b><font color="#9c1818">FOWLS</font></b> of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? (<scripRef>Matthew 6:26</scripRef>)

FRAY
<i>To make afraid; to scare.</i><br /><br />Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.  And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall <b><font color="#9c1818">FRAY</font></b> them away. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 7:32-33</scripRef>)

FRET
<i>To be grieved; troubled; displeased.</i><br /><br />Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: <b><font color="#9c1818">FRET</font></b> not thyself in any wise to do evil.  For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. (<scripRef>Psalm 37:8-9</scripRef>)

FROWARD
<i>Perverse; deceitful; false.</i><br /><br />Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.  Put away from thee a <b><font color="#9c1818">FROWARD</font></b> mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. (<scripRef>Proverbs 4:24-25</scripRef>)

FULLER
<i>Launderer; one who washes clothes.</i><br /><br />And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.  And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no <b><font color="#9c1818">FULLER</font></b> on earth can white them. (<scripRef>Mark 9:2-3</scripRef>)

FURBISH
<i>To scour and cleanse metal.</i><br /><br />Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; <b><font color="#9c1818">FURBISH</font></b> the spears, and put on the brigandines. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 46:3-4</scripRef>)

FURLONG
<i>Approximately 1/8 mile (660 feet).</i><br /><br />And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore <b><font color="#9c1818">FURLONG</font></b>S.  And they talked together of all these things which had happened. (<scripRef>Luke 24:13-14</scripRef>)

FURROW
<i>Groove in the earth made by a plow.</i><br /><br />If my land cry against me, or that the <b><font color="#9c1818">FURROW</font></b>S likewise thereof complain; if I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.  The words of Job are ended. (<scripRef>Job 31:38-40</scripRef>)

GADDEST
<i>To have roamed; to have gone away.</i><br /><br />Why <b><font color="#9c1818">GADDEST</font></b> thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 2:36-37</scripRef>)

GAINSAY
<i>To answer; to speak against.</i><br /><br />But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.  And it shall turn to you for a testimony.  Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to <b><font color="#9c1818">GAINSAY</font></b> nor resist. (<scripRef>Luke 21:12-15</scripRef>)

GAPE
<i>To open wide the mouth.</i><br /><br />Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.  Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.  They <b><font color="#9c1818">GAPE</font></b>D upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. (<scripRef>Psalm 22:11-13</scripRef>)

GARNER
<i>A barn; storehouse.</i><br /><br />I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the <b><font color="#9c1818">GARNER</font></b>; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. (<scripRef>Matthew 3:11-12</scripRef>)

GARRISON
<i>A guard, watch or patrol.</i><br /><br />In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a <b><font color="#9c1818">GARRISON</font></b>, desirous to apprehend me: and through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 11:32</scripRef>)

GENTILES
<i>A people; nations other than Israel.</i><br /><br />For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the <b><font color="#9c1818">GENTILES</font></b>; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. (<scripRef>Malachi 1:11</scripRef>)

GIN
<i>A noose; snare.</i><br /><br />Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set <b><font color="#9c1818">GIN</font></b>S for me. (<scripRef>Psalm 140:4-5</scripRef>)

GIRD
<i>To fasten, secure; to equip; prepare.</i><br /><br /><b><font color="#9c1818">GIRD</font></b> thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.  And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.  Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. (<scripRef>Psalm 45:3-5</scripRef>)

GIRDLE
<i>Belt.</i><br /><br />And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a <b><font color="#9c1818">GIRDLE</font></b> of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey. (<scripRef>Mark 1:5</scripRef>)

GIRT
<i>Belted; wrapped.</i><br /><br />Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he <b><font color="#9c1818">GIRT</font></b> his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. (<scripRef>John 21:7-8</scripRef>)

GOAD
<i>A pointed stick.</i><br /><br />The words of the wise are as <b><font color="#9c1818">GOAD</font></b>S, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. (<scripRef>Ecclesiastes 12:11</scripRef>)

GOD SPEED
<i>A greeting.</i><br /><br />If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him <b><font color="#9c1818">GOD SPEED</font></b>: For he that biddeth him <b><font color="#9c1818">GOD SPEED</font></b> is partaker of his evil deeds. (<scripRef>2 John 1:10-11</scripRef>)

GOSPEL
<i>Good news.</i><br /><br />And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the <b><font color="#9c1818">GOSPEL</font></b> of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. (<scripRef>Matthew 4:23</scripRef>)

GRACE
<i>Kindness; favor.</i><br /><br />But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by <b><font color="#9c1818">GRACE</font></b> ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his <b><font color="#9c1818">GRACE</font></b> in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.  For by <b><font color="#9c1818">GRACE</font></b> are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. (<scripRef>Ephesians 2:4-9</scripRef>)

GRAVEN
<i>To cut or engrave.</i><br /><br />Oh that my words were now written!  Oh that they were printed in a book!  That they were <b><font color="#9c1818">GRAVEN</font></b> with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! (<scripRef>Job 19:23-24</scripRef>)

GRAVITY
<i>Dignity.</i><br /><br />A bishop then must be blameless...; one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all <b><font color="#9c1818">GRAVITY</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:2,3</scripRef>)

GRISLED
<i>Spotted; speckled.</i><br /><br />And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot <b><font color="#9c1818">GRISLED</font></b> and bay horses. (<scripRef>Zechariah 3:3</scripRef>)

GROSS
<i>Fat; thick.</i><br /><br />For this people's heart is waxed <b><font color="#9c1818">GROSS</font></b>, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. (<scripRef>Matthew 13:15</scripRef>)

GUILE
<i>Deceit; craftiness.</i><br /><br />And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no <b><font color="#9c1818">GUILE</font></b>!  Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. (<scripRef>John 1:46-48</scripRef>)

HABERGEON
<i>A coat of armor.</i><br /><br />And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an <b><font color="#9c1818">HABERGEON</font></b>, that it be not rent. (<scripRef>Exodus 28:32</scripRef>)

HAFT
<i>A handle.</i><br /><br />And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: and the <b><font color="#9c1818">HAFT</font></b> also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. (<scripRef>Judges 3:21-22</scripRef>)

HAIL
<i>A greeting of joy and peace.</i><br /><br />And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All <b><font color="#9c1818">HAIL</font></b>. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. (<scripRef>Matthew 28:8-9</scripRef>)

HALE
<i>To draw; drag; force.</i><br /><br />When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he <b><font color="#9c1818">HALE</font></b> thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.  I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. (<scripRef>Luke 12:58</scripRef>)

HALLOW
<i>To make holy; to set apart from common.</i><br /><br />After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, <b><font color="#9c1818">HALLOW</font></b>ED be thy name.  Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:9</scripRef>)

HALT
<i>Lame; crippled in the feet.</i><br /><br />Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life <b><font color="#9c1818">HALT</font></b> or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. (<scripRef>Matthew 18:8</scripRef>)

HAPLY
<i>Perhaps.</i><br /><br />And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if <b><font color="#9c1818">HAPLY</font></b> he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. (<scripRef>Mark 11:11-12</scripRef>)

HARD BY
<i>Beside; next to.</i><br /><br />And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, <b><font color="#9c1818">HARD BY</font></b> the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. (<scripRef>1 Kings 21:1</scripRef>)

HARROW
<i>A sharp, pointed instrument.</i><br /><br />And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.  And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with <b><font color="#9c1818">HARROW</font></b>S of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. (<scripRef>1 Chronicles 20:3-4</scripRef>)

HART
<i>A deer; hind.</i><br /><br />As the <b><font color="#9c1818">HART</font></b> panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. (<scripRef>Psalm 42:1</scripRef>)

HASTE
<i>To hurry; to urge on quickly.</i><br /><br />If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath <b><font color="#9c1818">HASTE</font></b>D to deceit; Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. (<scripRef>Job 31:5-6</scripRef>)

HAUGHTY
<i>Proud; arrogant; lifted up.</i><br /><br />LORD, my heart is not <b><font color="#9c1818">HAUGHTY</font></b>, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. (<scripRef>Psalm 131:1</scripRef>)

HAUNT
<i>To inhabit, visit or dwell.</i><br /><br />And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;  To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,  And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to <b><font color="#9c1818">HAUNT</font></b>. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 26:26-27,31</scripRef>)

HEADY
<i>Reckless; hasty; headstrong.</i><br /><br />This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, <b><font color="#9c1818">HEADY</font></b>, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. (<scripRef>2 Timothy 3:1-4</scripRef>)

HEARTH
<i>A furnace; fire.</i><br /><br />Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.  For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an <b><font color="#9c1818">HEARTH</font></b>. (<scripRef>Psalm 102:2-3</scripRef>)

HEATH
<i>A shrub or tree.</i><br /><br />Flee, save your lives, and be like the <b><font color="#9c1818">HEATH</font></b> in the wilderness.  For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 48:6-7</scripRef>)

HEATHEN
<i>People; nations; non-Jews.</i><br /><br />Why do the <b><font color="#9c1818">HEATHEN</font></b> rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. (<scripRef>Psalm 2:1-4</scripRef>)

HEED
<i>To be careful to consider.</i><br /><br />Take <b><font color="#9c1818">HEED</font></b> that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.  Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:1-2</scripRef>)

HELL
<i>The valley of Hinnom.</i><br /><br />And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into <b><font color="#9c1818">HELL</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:30</scripRef>)

HENCEFORTH
<i>From this time forth; from now on.</i><br /><br />Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from <b><font color="#9c1818">HENCEFORTH</font></b> even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. (<scripRef>Isaiah 9:7</scripRef>)

HERBS
<i>Vegetables.</i><br /><br />Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth <b><font color="#9c1818">HERBS</font></b>.  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. (<scripRef>Romans 14:1-3</scripRef>)

HERETIC
<i>One who causes divisions, factions.</i><br /><br />A man that is an <b><font color="#9c1818">HERETIC</font></b> after the first and second admonition reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. (<scripRef>Titus 3:10-11</scripRef>)

HERETOFORE
<i>Previously.</i><br /><br />I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which <b><font color="#9c1818">HERETOFORE</font></b> have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 13:2</scripRef>)

HEREWITH
<i>With this.</i><br /><br />Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.  Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied <b><font color="#9c1818">HEREWITH</font></b>. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 16:28-29</scripRef>)

HERITAGE
<i>Allotment; possession.</i><br /><br />Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's <b><font color="#9c1818">HERITAGE</font></b>, but being ensamples to the flock. (<scripRef>1 Peter 5:2-3</scripRef>)

HEWN
<i>Cut.</i><br /><br />A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is <b><font color="#9c1818">HEWN</font></b> down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. (<scripRef>Matthew 7:18-20</scripRef>)

HIN
<i>A liquid measurement.</i><br /><br />Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an <b><font color="#9c1818">HIN</font></b>: from time to time shalt thou drink. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 4:11</scripRef>)

HINDER
<i>Latter; rear; behind.</i><br /><br />And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the <b><font color="#9c1818">HINDER</font></b> sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. (<scripRef>Zechariah 14:8</scripRef>)

HINDS
<i>Deer or mountain goats.</i><br /><br />It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  He maketh my feet like <b><font color="#9c1818">HINDS</font></b>' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. (<scripRef>Psalm 18:32-33</scripRef>)

HIRELING
<i>A laborer employed on hire.</i><br /><br />But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an <b><font color="#9c1818">HIRELING</font></b>, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble. (<scripRef>Isaiah 16:14</scripRef>)

HISS
<i>Whistle.</i><br /><br />And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will <b><font color="#9c1818">HISS</font></b> unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly. (<scripRef>Isaiah 5:26</scripRef>)

HOARY
<i>White colored.</i><br /><br />Hath the rain a father?  Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?  Out of whose womb came the ice?  And the <b><font color="#9c1818">HOARY</font></b> frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? (<scripRef>Job 38:28-29</scripRef>)

HOCK
<i>To disable by cutting a leg muscle.</i><br /><br />And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt <b><font color="#9c1818">HOCK</font></b> their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. (<scripRef>Joshua 11:6</scripRef>)

HOLDEN
<i>Held.</i><br /><br />I have long time <b><font color="#9c1818">HOLDEN</font></b> my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.  I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. (<scripRef>Isaiah 42:14-15</scripRef>)

HOLLOW
<i>Palm; cup.</i><br /><br />Who hath measured the waters in the <b><font color="#9c1818">HOLLOW</font></b> of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?  Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?  With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding? (<scripRef>Isaiah 40:12-14</scripRef>)

HOLPEN
<i>Helped.</i><br /><br />O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

(<scripRef>Psalm 86:16-17</scripRef>)

HOSANNA
<i>"Save now!"; "Save, I pray!".</i><br /><br />On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, <b><font color="#9c1818">HOSANNA</font></b>: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. (<scripRef>John 12:12-13</scripRef>)

HOSEN
<i>Tunics; under garments.</i><br /><br />Then these men were bound in their coats, their <b><font color="#9c1818">HOSEN</font></b>, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. (<scripRef>Daniel 3:21</scripRef>)

HUNGRED
<i>To have been hungry.</i><br /><br />At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an <b><font color="#9c1818">HUNGRED</font></b>, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. (<scripRef>Matthew 12:1</scripRef>)

HUSBANDMAN
<i>A farmer; one who tills the ground.</i><br /><br />The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.  Be ye ashamed, O ye HUSBANDMEN; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. (<scripRef>Joel 1:10-11</scripRef>)

HYSSOP
<i>A bitter herb.</i><br /><br />After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon <b><font color="#9c1818">HYSSOP</font></b>, and put it to his mouth.  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. (<scripRef>John 19:28-30</scripRef>)

IGNOMINY
<i>Contempt; shame; dishonor.</i><br /><br />When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with <b><font color="#9c1818">IGNOMINY</font></b> reproach. (<scripRef>Proverbs 18:3</scripRef>)

IMMORTAL
<i>Incapable of corruption.</i><br /><br />Now unto the King eternal, <b><font color="#9c1818">IMMORTAL</font></b>, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 1:17</scripRef>)

IMMORTALITY
<i>Incorruption; an imperishable state.</i><br /><br />So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on <b><font color="#9c1818">IMMORTALITY</font></b>, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 15:54</scripRef>)

IMMUTABLE
<i>Unchangeable.</i><br /><br />Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two <b><font color="#9c1818">IMMUTABLE</font></b> things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. (<scripRef>Hebrews 6:17-18</scripRef>)

IMPENITENT
<i>Without remorse.</i><br /><br />But after thy hardness and <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPENITENT</font></b> heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds. (<scripRef>Romans 2:5-6</scripRef>)

IMPERIOUS
<i>Hard-faced; bold.</i><br /><br />How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPERIOUS</font></b> whorish woman; In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire; but as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband! (<scripRef>Ezekiel 16:30-32</scripRef>)

IMPLACABLE
<i>Unyielding; obstinate.</i><br /><br />And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPLACABLE</font></b>, unmerciful. (<scripRef>Romans 1:28-31</scripRef>)

IMPLEAD
<i>To bring an accusation against.</i><br /><br />For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPLEAD</font></b> one another. (<scripRef>Acts 19:37-38</scripRef>)

IMPORTUNITY
<i>Lack of modesty; shamelessness.</i><br /><br />And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.  I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPORTUNITY</font></b> he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. (<scripRef>Luke 11:7-8</scripRef>)

IMPUDENT
<i>Stubborn; hard-faced.</i><br /><br />But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPUDENT</font></b> and hardhearted.  Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 3:7-8</scripRef>)

IMPUTE
<i>To reckon or count.</i><br /><br />Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not <b><font color="#9c1818">IMPUTE</font></b> sin. (<scripRef>Romans 4:8</scripRef>)

IN ANY WISE
<i>Surely.</i><br /><br />When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me; thou shalt <b><font color="#9c1818">IN ANY WISE</font></b> set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother. (<scripRef>Deuteronomy 17:14-15</scripRef>)

IN NO WISE
<i>By no means; assuredly not.</i><br /><br />Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall <b><font color="#9c1818">IN NO WISE</font></b> pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:17-18</scripRef>)

INCONTINENCY
<i>Lack of self-control.</i><br /><br />The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your <b><font color="#9c1818">INCONTINENCY</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Corinthians 7:4-5</scripRef>)

INCONTINENT
<i>Unbridled; uncontrollable.</i><br /><br />This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, <b><font color="#9c1818">INCONTINENT</font></b>, fierce, despisers of those that are good. (<scripRef>2 Timothy 3:1-3</scripRef>)

INDIGNATION
<i>Wrath; anger.</i><br /><br />Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.  For the <b><font color="#9c1818">INDIGNATION</font></b> of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. (<scripRef>Isaiah 34:1-2</scripRef>)

INDITING
<i>Overflowing; boiling over.</i><br /><br />My heart is <b><font color="#9c1818">INDITING</font></b> a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. (<scripRef>Psalm 45:1</scripRef>)

INFAMY
<i>An evil report.</i><br /><br />Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine <b><font color="#9c1818">INFAMY</font></b> turn not away. (<scripRef>Proverbs 25:9-10</scripRef>)

INFIDEL
<i>An unbeliever.</i><br /><br />But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an <b><font color="#9c1818">INFIDEL</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 5:8</scripRef>)

INIQUITY
<i>Sin; wickedness; evil.</i><br /><br />Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work <b><font color="#9c1818">INIQUITY</font></b>: and let me not eat of their dainties. (<scripRef>Psalm 141:3-4</scripRef>)

INORDINATE
<i>Without restraint; immoderate.</i><br /><br />These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her <b><font color="#9c1818">INORDINATE</font></b> love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 23:10-11</scripRef>)

INSTANT
<i>Insistent; steadfast; urgent.</i><br /><br />And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.  And they were <b><font color="#9c1818">INSTANT</font></b> with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. (<scripRef>Luke 23:22-23</scripRef>)

INSTANTLY
<i>Earnestly.</i><br /><br />And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:  Unto which promise our twelve tribes, <b><font color="#9c1818">INSTANTLY</font></b> serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. (<scripRef>Acts 26:6-7</scripRef>)

JACINTH
<i>A precious stone.</i><br /><br />And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;  The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a <b><font color="#9c1818">JACINTH</font></b>; the twelfth, an amethyst. (<scripRef>Revelation 21:19-20</scripRef>)

JANGLING
<i>Foolish, empty talk.</i><br /><br />Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned: from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain <b><font color="#9c1818">JANGLING</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 1:5-6</scripRef>)

JOINED HARD
<i>To border; to be adjacent to.</i><br /><br />And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house <b><font color="#9c1818">JOINED HARD</font></b> to the synagogue. (<scripRef>Acts 18:6-7</scripRef>)

JONAS
<i>Jonah.</i><br /><br />And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of <b><font color="#9c1818">JONAS</font></b> the prophet. For as <b><font color="#9c1818">JONAS</font></b> was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation. (<scripRef>Luke 11:29-30</scripRef>)

JOT
<i>The smallest Hebrew letter.</i><br /><br />Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one <b><font color="#9c1818">JOT</font></b> or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:17-18</scripRef>)

KERCHIEF
<i>Veil; covering.</i><br /><br />Your <b><font color="#9c1818">KERCHIEF</font></b>S also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 13:21</scripRef>)

KIN
<i>Family.</i><br /><br />Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.  But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own <b><font color="#9c1818">KIN</font></b>, and in his own house. (<scripRef>Mark 6:4</scripRef>)

KINDRED
<i>Tribe; family.</i><br /><br />The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.  All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the <b><font color="#9c1818">KINDRED</font></b>S of the nations shall worship before thee.  For the kingdom is the LORD'S: and he is the governor among the nations. (<scripRef>Psalm 22:26-28</scripRef>)

KINE
<i>Cows; cattle.</i><br /><br />And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured <b><font color="#9c1818">KINE</font></b> and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. (<scripRef>Genesis 41:1-2</scripRef>)

KINSFOLK
<i>Family; relatives.</i><br /><br />And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.  But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their <b><font color="#9c1818">KINSFOLK</font></b> and acquaintance. (<scripRef>Luke 2:43-44</scripRef>)

KINSMEN
<i>Neighbors; relatives.</i><br /><br />Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.  My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.  My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my <b><font color="#9c1818">KINSMEN</font></b> stand afar off. (<scripRef>Psalm 38:9-11</scripRef>)

KNOPS
<i>Decorative ornaments.</i><br /><br />And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his <b><font color="#9c1818">KNOPS</font></b>, and his flowers, shall be of the same. (<scripRef>Exodus 25:31</scripRef>)

LADE
<i>To burden; to load.</i><br /><br />And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye <b><font color="#9c1818">LADE</font></b> men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. (<scripRef>Luke 11:46</scripRef>)

LADEN
<i>Loaded; burdened.</i><br /><br />Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy <b><font color="#9c1818">LADEN</font></b>, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (<scripRef>Matthew 11:28-30</scripRef>)

LADETH
<i>Burdens; loads.</i><br /><br />Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that <b><font color="#9c1818">LADETH</font></b> himself with thick clay! (<scripRef>Habakkuk 2:6</scripRef>)

LADING
<i>A burden; load; cargo.</i><br /><br />Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the <b><font color="#9c1818">LADING</font></b> and ship, but also of our lives. (<scripRef>Acts 27:9-10</scripRef>)

LANGUISH
<i>Wither; to be made weak.</i><br /><br />The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.  The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world <b><font color="#9c1818">LANGUISH</font></b>eth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do <b><font color="#9c1818">LANGUISH</font></b>. (<scripRef>Isaiah 24:3-4</scripRef>)

LASCIVIOUSNESS
<i>Unbridled sensuality; excess.</i><br /><br />For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, <b><font color="#9c1818">LASCIVIOUSNESS</font></b>. (<scripRef>Galatians 5:17-19</scripRef>)

LATTER
<i>Last.</i><br /><br />For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the <b><font color="#9c1818">LATTER</font></b> day upon the earth. (<scripRef>Job 19:25</scripRef>)

LAUD
<i>To applaud; praise.</i><br /><br />And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and <b><font color="#9c1818">LAUD</font></b> him, all ye people. (<scripRef>Romans 15:9-11</scripRef>)

LAVER
<i>Wash basin.</i><br /><br />Thou shalt also make a <b><font color="#9c1818">LAVER</font></b> of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.  For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat. (<scripRef>Exodus 30:18-19</scripRef>)

LAWYER
<i>Person skilled in the Law of Moses.</i><br /><br />Woe unto you, <b><font color="#9c1818">LAWYER</font></b>S! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. (<scripRef>Luke 11:52</scripRef>)

LEASING
<i>Falsehood; deceit.</i><br /><br />The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.  Thou shalt destroy them that speak <b><font color="#9c1818">LEASING</font></b>: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. (<scripRef>Psalm 5:5-6</scripRef>)

LEATHERN
<i>Made of skin.</i><br /><br />And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a <b><font color="#9c1818">LEATHERN</font></b> girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. (<scripRef>Matthew 3:4</scripRef>)

LEES
<i>Sediment.</i><br /><br />Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his <b><font color="#9c1818">LEES</font></b>, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 48:11-12</scripRef>)

LEGION
<i>An indefinite large number.</i><br /><br />Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve <b><font color="#9c1818">LEGION</font></b>S of angels? (<scripRef>Matthew 26:52-53</scripRef>)

LET
<i>To hinder or obstruct.</i><br /><br />Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was <b><font color="#9c1818">LET</font></b> hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. (<scripRef>Romans 1:13</scripRef>)

LEVIATHAN
<i>Crocodile.</i><br /><br />Canst thou draw out <b><font color="#9c1818">LEVIATHAN</font></b> with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?  Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.  His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. (<scripRef>Job 41:1</scripRef>)

LEWDNESS
<i>Villany; wickedness; crime.</i><br /><br />And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked <b><font color="#9c1818">LEWDNESS</font></b>, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: but if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. (<scripRef>Acts 18:14-15</scripRef>)

LISTED
<i>To have pleased; chosen.</i><br /><br />But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they <b><font color="#9c1818">LISTED</font></b>.  Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. (<scripRef>Matthew 17:12</scripRef>)

LISTETH
<i>To please; to choose.</i><br /><br />Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it <b><font color="#9c1818">LISTETH</font></b>, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? (<scripRef>John 3:7-9</scripRef>)

LITTER
<i>A cart carried by others with poles.</i><br /><br />And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.  And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in <b><font color="#9c1818">LITTER</font></b>S, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. (<scripRef>Isaiah 66:19-20</scripRef>)

LIVELY
<i>Living.</i><br /><br />Ye also, as <b><font color="#9c1818">LIVELY</font></b> stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. (<scripRef>1 Peter 2:5</scripRef>)

LOFT
<i>Story; floor; roof.</i><br /><br />And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.  And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third <b><font color="#9c1818">LOFT</font></b>, and was taken up dead. (<scripRef>Acts 20:8-9</scripRef>)

LOINS
<i>The lower back; waist.</i><br /><br />And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his <b><font color="#9c1818">LOINS</font></b>; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. (<scripRef>Matthew 3:4</scripRef>)

LOP
<i>To cut off.</i><br /><br />Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall <b><font color="#9c1818">LOP</font></b> the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. (<scripRef>Isaiah 10:33-34</scripRef>)

LOT
<i>Portion; destiny; fate.</i><br /><br />The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my <b><font color="#9c1818">LOT</font></b>. (<scripRef>Psalm 16:5</scripRef>)

LOWERING
<i>To appear gloomy; overcast.</i><br /><br />He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and <b><font color="#9c1818">LOWERING</font></b>.  O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? (<scripRef>Matthew 16:3</scripRef>)

LOWETH
<i>To moo (cow noise).</i><br /><br />Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or <b><font color="#9c1818">LOWETH</font></b> the ox over his fodder? (<scripRef>Job 6:5</scripRef>)

LOWING
<i>Mooing; making cow noises.</i><br /><br />And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, <b><font color="#9c1818">LOWING</font></b> as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. (<scripRef>1 Samuel 6:11-12</scripRef>)

LUCRE
<i>Gain.</i><br /><br />A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy <b><font color="#9c1818">LUCRE</font></b>; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:2-3</scripRef>)

MADE MANIFEST
<i>To be made visible; to make clear.</i><br /><br />But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was <b><font color="#9c1818">MADE MANIFEST</font></b> unto them that asked not after me.  But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. (<scripRef>Romans 10:20-21</scripRef>)

MAIMED
<i>Crippled, or deprived of some member.</i><br /><br />And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, <b><font color="#9c1818">MAIMED</font></b>, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them. (<scripRef>Matthew 15:30</scripRef>)

MALEFACTOR
<i>Evil-doer.</i><br /><br />Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.  Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  They answered and said unto him, If he were not a <b><font color="#9c1818">MALEFACTOR</font></b>, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. (<scripRef>John 18:28-30</scripRef>)

MALICE
<i>Ill-will; badness.</i><br /><br />Wherefore laying aside all <b><font color="#9c1818">MALICE</font></b>, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. (<scripRef>1 Peter 2:1-2</scripRef>)

MALLOWS
<i>A type of plant, or herb.</i><br /><br />For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.  Who cut up <b><font color="#9c1818">MALLOWS</font></b> by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. (<scripRef>Job 30:3-4</scripRef>)

MAMMON
<i>Earthly goods; property; riches.</i><br /><br />No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and <b><font color="#9c1818">MAMMON</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:24</scripRef>)

MANDRAKE
<i>Some lovely fruit or flower.</i><br /><br />And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found <b><font color="#9c1818">MANDRAKE</font></b>S in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's <b><font color="#9c1818">MANDRAKE</font></b>S. (<scripRef>Genesis 30:14</scripRef>)

MANIFEST
<i>To make openly known; appear.</i><br /><br />And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was <b><font color="#9c1818">MANIFEST</font></b> in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:16</scripRef>)

MANIFOLD MORE
<i>Many times more.</i><br /><br />And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive <b><font color="#9c1818">MANIFOLD MORE</font></b> in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. (<scripRef>Luke 18:29-30</scripRef>)

(<scripRef>Acts 6:5-6</scripRef>)

PROSPECT
<i>Face.</i><br /><br />And he said unto me, This chamber, whose <b><font color="#9c1818">PROSPECT</font></b> is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.  And the chamber whose <b><font color="#9c1818">PROSPECT</font></b> is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

<i>Stealing; pilfering.</i><br /><br />Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not <b><font color="#9c1818">PURLOINING</font></b>, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

She turned herself, and saith unto him, <b><font color="#9c1818">RABBONI</font></b>; which is to say, Master.

(<scripRef>John 20:15-17</scripRef>)

STABLISHETH
<i>Establishes; makes steadfast.</i><br /><br />Now he which <b><font color="#9c1818">STABLISHETH</font></b> us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 1:21-22</scripRef>)

(<scripRef>Jeremiah 50:1-2</scripRef>)

STATURE
<i>Maturity of life; age; adultness.</i><br /><br />Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his <b><font color="#9c1818">STATURE</font></b>?  And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:27-29</scripRef>)

STAVES
<i>Rods; clubs.</i><br /><br />And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far.

(<scripRef>Luke 22:50-52</scripRef>)

Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. (<scripRef>Luke 12:42</scripRef>)

STIRS
<i>Noises; tumults.</i><br /><br />Thou that art full of <b><font color="#9c1818">STIRS</font></b>, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far. (<scripRef>Isaiah 22:2-3</scripRef>)

STOMACHER
<i>A fine robe.</i><br /><br />And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a <b><font color="#9c1818">STOMACHER</font></b> a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. (<scripRef>Isaiah 3:24</scripRef>)

STOUT
<i>Strong; great.</i><br /><br />The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

STRAIGHTWAY
<i>Immediately.</i><br /><br />And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.  And <b><font color="#9c1818">STRAIGHTWAY</font></b> they forsook their nets, and followed him. (<scripRef>Mark 1:17-18</scripRef>)

STRAIT
<i>Narrow.</i><br /><br />Enter ye in at the <b><font color="#9c1818">STRAIT</font></b> gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because <b><font color="#9c1818">STRAIT</font></b> is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (<scripRef>Matthew 7:13-14</scripRef>)

STRAITENED
<i>Hindered; impeded.</i><br /><br />I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be <b><font color="#9c1818">STRAITENED</font></b>; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. (<scripRef>Proverbs 4:11-12</scripRef>)

STRIKER
<i>One apt to inflict blows or hit another.</i><br /><br />For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no <b><font color="#9c1818">STRIKER</font></b>, not given to filthy lucre. (<scripRef>Titus 1:7</scripRef>)

STROWED, STRAWED
<i>Scattered; spread.</i><br /><br />And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and STROWED them in the way.

(<scripRef>Matthew 21:8-9</scripRef>)

SUCCOUR
<i>To help; aid.</i><br /><br />Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to <b><font color="#9c1818">SUCCOUR</font></b> them that are tempted. (<scripRef>Hebrews 2:17-18</scripRef>)

SUCCOURER
<i>Helper.</i><br /><br />I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: that ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a <b><font color="#9c1818">SUCCOURER</font></b> of many, and of myself also. (<scripRef>Romans 16:2</scripRef>)

SUMPTUOUSLY
<i>Splendidly.</i><br /><br />There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared <b><font color="#9c1818">SUMPTUOUSLY</font></b> every day: and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. (<scripRef>Luke 16:19-21</scripRef>)

SUNDRY
<i>Various; many.</i><br /><br />God, who at <b><font color="#9c1818">SUNDRY</font></b> times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds. (<scripRef>Hebrews 1:1-2</scripRef>)

SUP
<i>To dine; to make a meal.</i><br /><br />Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will <b><font color="#9c1818">SUP</font></b> with him, and he with me. (<scripRef>Revelation 3</scripRef>)

SUPERFLUITY
<i>Super abundance; overflowing.</i><br /><br />Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPERFLUITY</font></b> of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. (<scripRef>James 1:21</scripRef>)

SUPERFLUOUS
<i>Over and above; more than enough.</i><br /><br />For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPERFLUOUS</font></b> for me to write to you: for I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 9:1-2</scripRef>)

SUPERSCRIPTION
<i>Inscription; title; a writing over.</i><br /><br />Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.

SUPPLANT
<i>To deceive; defraud.</i><br /><br />And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPPLANT</font></b>, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.  And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 9:3-5</scripRef>)

SUPPLE
<i>To clean by washing.</i><br /><br />And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.  And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPPLE</font></b> thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 16:3-4</scripRef>)

SUPPLIANT
<i>Worshipper.</i><br /><br />For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.  From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPPLIANT</font></b>S, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. (<scripRef>Zephaniah 3:9-10</scripRef>)

SUPPLICATION
<i>Petition; an expression of need.</i><br /><br />I exhort therefore, that, first of all, <b><font color="#9c1818">SUPPLICATION</font></b>S, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 2:1</scripRef>)

SURFEITING
<i>Intoxication; overindulgence.</i><br /><br />And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with <b><font color="#9c1818">SURFEITING</font></b>, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.  For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. (<scripRef>Luke 21:34-35</scripRef>)

SURMISINGS
<i>Suspicions.</i><br /><br />If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;  He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil <b><font color="#9c1818">SURMISINGS</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 6:3-4</scripRef>)

SWADDLING CLOTHES
<i>Clothes used for wrapping.</i><br /><br />And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in <b><font color="#9c1818">SWADDLING CLOTHES</font></b>, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. (<scripRef>Luke 2:7</scripRef>)

SWELLINGS
<i>Puffed-up, inflated attitudes; conceits.</i><br /><br />For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, <b><font color="#9c1818">SWELLINGS</font></b>, tumults. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 12:20</scripRef>)

SWINE
<i>Pigs.</i><br /><br />Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before <b><font color="#9c1818">SWINE</font></b>, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. (<scripRef>Matthew 7:6</scripRef>)

TABERING
<i>To strike (especially the tabret).</i><br /><br />The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.

(<scripRef>Nahum 2:6-7</scripRef>)

TABERNACLE
<i>A tent, booth or dwelling.</i><br /><br />Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.  The light shall be dark in his <b><font color="#9c1818">TABERNACLE</font></b>, and his candle shall be put out with him. (<scripRef>Job 18:5-6</scripRef>)

TABRET
<i>Tambourine.</i><br /><br />Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!  And the harp, and the viol, the <b><font color="#9c1818">TABRET</font></b>, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. (<scripRef>Isaiah 5:11-12</scripRef>)

TACHES
<i>Hooks; fasteners.</i><br /><br />And thou shalt make fifty <b><font color="#9c1818">TACHES</font></b> of gold, and couple the curtains together with the <b><font color="#9c1818">TACHES</font></b>: and it shall be one (<scripRef>Exodus 26:6</scripRef>)

TALE
<i>A carefully counted number.</i><br /><br />Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.  And the <b><font color="#9c1818">TALE</font></b> of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. (<scripRef>Exodus 5:7-8</scripRef>)

TALENT
<i>A weight, money, or gift.</i><br /><br />Then he that had received the five <b><font color="#9c1818">TALENT</font></b>S went and traded with the same, and made them other five <b><font color="#9c1818">TALENT</font></b>s.   And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. (<scripRef>Matthew 25:16-18</scripRef>)

TARES
<i>Weeds found in grain.</i><br /><br />Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:   But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed <b><font color="#9c1818">TARES</font></b> among the wheat, and went his way. (<scripRef>Matthew 13:24-25</scripRef>)

TAUNT
<i>An object of scorn and derision.</i><br /><br />Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.  So it shall be a reproach and a <b><font color="#9c1818">TAUNT</font></b>, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.  I the LORD have spoken it. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 5:14-15</scripRef>)

TEATS
<i>Breasts.</i><br /><br />Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: and they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the <b><font color="#9c1818">TEATS</font></b> of their virginity. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 23:2-3</scripRef>)

TELL
<i>To number; count.</i><br /><br />And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and <b><font color="#9c1818">TELL</font></b> the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. (<scripRef>Genesis 15:4-5</scripRef>)

TEMPERANCE
<i>Self-control.</i><br /><br />But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, <b><font color="#9c1818">TEMPERANCE</font></b>: against such there is no law.  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. (<scripRef>Galatians 5:22-24</scripRef>)

TEMPERATE
<i>To exercise power or self-control.</i><br /><br />Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?  So run, that ye may obtain.

(<scripRef>1 Corinthians 9:24-25</scripRef>)

TEMPEST
<i>Storm; whirlwind.</i><br /><br />The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

TESTAMENT
<i>A covenant; an agreement.</i><br /><br />For where a <b><font color="#9c1818">TESTAMENT</font></b> is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  For a <b><font color="#9c1818">TESTAMENT</font></b> is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  Whereupon neither the first <b><font color="#9c1818">TESTAMENT</font></b> was dedicated without blood. (<scripRef>Hebrews 9:16-18</scripRef>)

THENCE
<i>There; that place.</i><br /><br />Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.

(<scripRef>Jeremiah 50:4-5</scripRef>)

THREESCORE
<i>Sixty.</i><br /><br />Here is wisdom.  Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred <b><font color="#9c1818">THREESCORE</font></b> and six. (<scripRef>Revelation 13</scripRef>)

THRICE
<i>Three times.</i><br /><br />Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me <b><font color="#9c1818">THRICE</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 26:35-36</scripRef>)

TIRSHATHA

TITHE
<i>The tenth part; 1/10.</i><br /><br />And all the <b><font color="#9c1818">TITHE</font></b> of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD. (<scripRef>Leviticus 27:30</scripRef>)

TITTLE
<i>A point of a letter of the alphabet.</i><br /><br />Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one <b><font color="#9c1818">TITTLE</font></b> shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:17-18</scripRef>)

TOLD OUT
<i>Numbered; tallied.</i><br /><br />And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

(<scripRef>2 Chronicles 2:1-2</scripRef>)

TOW
<i>The short fibers of the flax plant.</i><br /><br />Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.  And she said unto him, the Philistines be upon thee, Samson.

TRANSGRESSION
<i>Wrong-doing; a violation of a law.</i><br /><br />Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, I am clean without <b><font color="#9c1818">TRANSGRESSION</font></b>, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. (<scripRef>Job 33:8-9</scripRef>)

TRAVERSING
<i>Turning; interweaving; entangling.</i><br /><br />How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?  See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary <b><font color="#9c1818">TRAVERSING</font></b> her ways. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 2:23</scripRef>)

TRESPASS
<i>Wrong-doing; sin.</i><br /><br />For if ye forgive men their <b><font color="#9c1818">TRESPASS</font></b>ES, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their <b><font color="#9c1818">TRESPASS</font></b>ES, neither will your Father forgive your <b><font color="#9c1818">TRESPASS</font></b>ES. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:14-15</scripRef>)

TRODDEN
<i>Trampled.</i><br /><br />Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?  It is thenceforth good nothing but to be cast out, and to be <b><font color="#9c1818">TRODDEN</font></b> under foot of men. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:13</scripRef>)

TRODE

(<scripRef>Luke 12:1</scripRef>)

TROW
<i>Think.</i><br /><br />But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?  And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?  I <b><font color="#9c1818">TROW</font></b> not. (<scripRef>Luke 17:9</scripRef>)

TRUMP

TWAIN
<i>Two.</i><br /><br />For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and they <b><font color="#9c1818">TWAIN</font></b> shall be one flesh: so then they are no more <b><font color="#9c1818">TWAIN</font></b>, but one flesh.   What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. (<scripRef>Mark 10:7-9</scripRef>)

TYRUS
<i>Tyre, city of.</i><br /><br />Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O <b><font color="#9c1818">TYRUS</font></b>, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. (<scripRef>Ezekiel 26:3</scripRef>)

UNICORN
<i>Wild ox.</i><br /><br />Will the <b><font color="#9c1818">UNICORN</font></b> be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?  Canst thou bind the <b><font color="#9c1818">UNICORN</font></b> with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?  Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? (<scripRef>Job 39:9-12</scripRef>)

UNLADE
<i>To discharge; unload.</i><br /><br />And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.  Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to <b><font color="#9c1818">UNLADE</font></b> her burden. (<scripRef>Acts 21:2-3</scripRef>)

UNSHOD
<i>Barefoot.</i><br /><br />Withhold thy foot from being <b><font color="#9c1818">UNSHOD</font></b>, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 2:25</scripRef>)

UNTOWARD
<i>Perverse; bent.</i><br /><br />Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this <b><font color="#9c1818">UNTOWARD</font></b> generation. (<scripRef>Acts 2:38-40</scripRef>)

UPBRAID
<i>To scold; reproach; reprimand.</i><br /><br />If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and <b><font color="#9c1818">UPBRAID</font></b>ETH not; and it shall be given him. (<scripRef>James 1:5</scripRef>)

USURY
<i>Interest.</i><br /><br />And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.  And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant.  Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with <b><font color="#9c1818">USURY</font></b>? (<scripRef>Luke 19:20-23</scripRef>)

VAIN
<i>Empty; foolish; useless.</i><br /><br />But when ye pray, use not <b><font color="#9c1818">VAIN</font></b> repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. (<scripRef>Matthew 6:7</scripRef>)

VALE

(<scripRef>Galatians 5:19-21</scripRef>)

VEHEMENTLY
<i>Violently; intensely.</i><br /><br />He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat <b><font color="#9c1818">VEHEMENTLY</font></b> upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. (<scripRef>Luke 6:48</scripRef>)

VERILY
<i>Truly; surely.</i><br /><br />Jesus answered them, <b><font color="#9c1818">VERILY</font></b>, <b><font color="#9c1818">VERILY</font></b>, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. (<scripRef>John 8:34</scripRef>)

VERITY
<i>Truth.</i><br /><br />Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and <b><font color="#9c1818">VERITY</font></b>. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 2:7</scripRef>)

VERMILION
<i>Red color.</i><br /><br />Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;  That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with <b><font color="#9c1818">VERMILION</font></b>. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 22:13-14</scripRef>)

VESTMENTS
<i>Garments; clothing.</i><br /><br />And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.  And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth <b><font color="#9c1818">VESTMENTS</font></b> for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth <b><font color="#9c1818">VESTMENTS</font></b>. (<scripRef>2 Kings 10:21-22</scripRef>)

VESTRY
<i>Wardrobe.</i><br /><br />And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.  And he said unto him that was over the <b><font color="#9c1818">VESTRY</font></b>, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments. (<scripRef>2 Kings 10:21-22</scripRef>)

VESTURE
<i>Garment; cloak; clothing.</i><br /><br />His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.  And he was clothed with a <b><font color="#9c1818">VESTURE</font></b> dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. (<scripRef>Revelation 19:12-13</scripRef>)

VIAL
<i>Bowl; goblet.</i><br /><br />And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the <b><font color="#9c1818">VIAL</font></b>S of the wrath of God upon the earth.  And the first went, and poured out his <b><font color="#9c1818">VIAL</font></b> upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. (<scripRef>Revelation 16:1-2</scripRef>)

VICTUALS
<i>Food; sustenance.</i><br /><br />And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves <b><font color="#9c1818">VICTUALS</font></b>. (<scripRef>Matthew 14:14-15</scripRef>)

VIGILANT
<i>Watchful.</i><br /><br />A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, <b><font color="#9c1818">VIGILANT</font></b>, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 3:2</scripRef>)

VILEST
<i>Lowest; despised.</i><br /><br />The wicked walk on every side, when the <b><font color="#9c1818">VILEST</font></b> men are exalted. (<scripRef>Psalm 12:8</scripRef>)

VILLANY
<i>Folly.</i><br /><br />Because they have committed <b><font color="#9c1818">VILLANY</font></b> in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 29:23</scripRef>)

VIOL
<i>Musical instrument; a kind of harp.</i><br /><br />Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!  And the harp, and the <b><font color="#9c1818">VIOL</font></b>, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. (<scripRef>Isaiah 5:11-12</scripRef>)

VIPER
<i>Snake.</i><br /><br />But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them, O generation of <b><font color="#9c1818">VIPER</font></b>S, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? (<scripRef>Matthew 3:7</scripRef>)

VISAGE
<i>An appearance; form.</i><br /><br />Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.  As many were astonied at thee; his <b><font color="#9c1818">VISAGE</font></b> was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. (<scripRef>Isaiah 52:13-14</scripRef>)

VOCATION
<i>A calling; invitation; summons.</i><br /><br />I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the <b><font color="#9c1818">VOCATION</font></b> wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. (<scripRef>Ephesians 4:1-3</scripRef>)

WALLOW
<i>To roll.</i><br /><br />O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and <b><font color="#9c1818">WALLOW</font></b> thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. (<scripRef>Jeremiah 6:26</scripRef>)

WANTON
<i>Excessive; rebellious.</i><br /><br />But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax <b><font color="#9c1818">WANTON</font></b> against Christ, they will marry; having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. (<scripRef>1 Timothy 5:11-12</scripRef>)

WANTONNESS
<i>Extreme indulgence in sensual pleasures.</i><br /><br />The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.  Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and <b><font color="#9c1818">WANTONNESS</font></b>, not in strife and envying. (<scripRef>Romans 13:12-13</scripRef>)

WARD
<i>Prison; custody.</i><br /><br />Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in <b><font color="#9c1818">WARD</font></b> in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker. (<scripRef>Genesis 41:9-10</scripRef>)

WATERSPOUT
<i>Waterfall.</i><br /><br />Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy <b><font color="#9c1818">WATERSPOUT</font></b>S: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. (<scripRef>Psalm 42:7</scripRef>)

WAX
<i>To grow; become; advance.</i><br /><br />Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which <b><font color="#9c1818">WAX</font></b> not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. (<scripRef>Luke 12:33</scripRef>)

WAYFARING MAN
<i>Traveler; passer-by.</i><br /><br />Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.  The highways lie waste, the <b><font color="#9c1818">WAYFARING MAN</font></b> ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. (<scripRef>Isaiah 33:7-8</scripRef>)

WEN
<i>A running sore.</i><br /><br />Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a <b><font color="#9c1818">WEN</font></b>, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. (<scripRef>Leviticus 22:22</scripRef>)

WENCH
<i>Maidservant.</i><br /><br />Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.  Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a <b><font color="#9c1818">WENCH</font></b> went and told them; and they went and told king David. (<scripRef>2 Samuel 17:16-17</scripRef>)

WERT
<i>Were; was.</i><br /><br />I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou <b><font color="#9c1818">WERT</font></b> cold or hot.  So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. (<scripRef>Revelation 3:15</scripRef>)

WHENCE
<i>From where.</i><br /><br />The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know <b><font color="#9c1818">WHENCE</font></b> I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell <b><font color="#9c1818">WHENCE</font></b> I come, and whither I go. (<scripRef>John 8:13-14</scripRef>)

WHEREFORE
<i>Why?; for what reason?; for what cause?</i><br /><br />But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <b><font color="#9c1818">WHEREFORE</font></b>? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. (<scripRef>Romans 9:31-32</scripRef>)

WHEREINSOEVER
<i>In whatever respect.</i><br /><br />I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit <b><font color="#9c1818">WHEREINSOEVER</font></b> any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 11:21</scripRef>)

WHEREWITH
<i>The things with which...</i><br /><br />Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  So shall I have <b><font color="#9c1818">WHEREWITH</font></b> to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. (<scripRef>Psalm 119:41-42</scripRef>)

WHEREWITHAL
<i>How?; By what means?</i><br /><br /><b><font color="#9c1818">WHEREWITHAL</font></b> shall a young man cleanse his way?  By taking heed thereto according to thy word. (<scripRef>Psalm 119:9</scripRef>)

WHET
<i>To sharpen.</i><br /><br />God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.  If he turn not, he will <b><font color="#9c1818">WHET</font></b> his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.  He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors. (<scripRef>Psalm 7:12</scripRef>)

WHIT
<i>A least bit.</i><br /><br />For I suppose I was not a <b><font color="#9c1818">WHIT</font></b> behind the very chiefest apostles. (<scripRef>2 Corinthians 11:5</scripRef>)

WHITHER
<i>Where; which place.</i><br /><br />The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and <b><font color="#9c1818">WHITHER</font></b> I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and <b><font color="#9c1818">WHITHER</font></b> I go. (<scripRef>John 8:13-14</scripRef>)

WHITHERSOEVER
<i>Wherever.</i><br /><br />And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee <b><font color="#9c1818">WHITHERSOEVER</font></b> thou goest.  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. (<scripRef>Matthew 8:19-20</scripRef>)

WHOREMONGER
<i>Sexually immoral person.</i><br /><br />For this ye know, that no <b><font color="#9c1818">WHOREMONGER</font></b>, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. (<scripRef>Ephesians 5:5</scripRef>)

WILES
<i>Cunning devices; methods.</i><br /><br />Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the <b><font color="#9c1818">WILES</font></b> of the devil. (<scripRef>Ephesians 6:10-11</scripRef>)

WIMPLE
<i>A woman's garment; shawl.</i><br /><br />The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the <b><font color="#9c1818">WIMPLE</font></b>S, and the crisping pins. (<scripRef>Isaiah 3:22</scripRef>)

WINEBIBBER
<i>Drinker of wine.</i><br /><br />For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.  The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a <b><font color="#9c1818">WINEBIBBER</font></b>, a friend of publicans and sinners.  But wisdom is justified of her children. (<scripRef>Matthew 11:18-19</scripRef>)

WINEFAT
<i>A collection trough beneath a winepress.</i><br /><br />And he began to speak unto them by parables.  A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the <b><font color="#9c1818">WINEFAT</font></b>, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. (<scripRef>Mark 12:1</scripRef>)

WIST
<i>Knew; to have known.</i><br /><br />And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?  <b><font color="#9c1818">WIST</font></b> ye not that I must be about my Father's business? (<scripRef>Luke 2:48-49</scripRef>)

WIT
<i>To know; to become aware of.</i><br /><br />And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to <b><font color="#9c1818">WIT</font></b> whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. (<scripRef>Genesis 24:19-21</scripRef>)

WITHAL
<i>At the same time; together with.</i><br /><br />But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.  Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.  Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.  For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not <b><font color="#9c1818">WITHAL</font></b> to signify the crimes laid against him. (<scripRef>Acts 25:25-27</scripRef>)

WITHAL
<i>With.</i><br /><br />So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself WITHAL; and he sat down among the ashes. (<scripRef>Job 2:7-8</scripRef>)

WITHOUT
<i>Outside.</i><br /><br />While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood <b><font color="#9c1818">WITHOUT</font></b>, desiring to speak with him.  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand <b><font color="#9c1818">WITHOUT</font></b>, desiring to speak with thee. (<scripRef>Matthew 12:46-47</scripRef>)

WITHS
<i>Cords; ropes.</i><br /><br />Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.  And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  And he brake the <b><font color="#9c1818">WITHS</font></b>, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire.  So his strength was not known. (<scripRef>Judges 6:9</scripRef>)

WOE
<i>An expression of grief or indignation.</i><br /><br />And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but <b><font color="#9c1818">WOE</font></b> unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!  It had been good for that man if he had not been born. (<scripRef>Matthew 26:23-24</scripRef>)

WONT
<i>To be accustomed to.</i><br /><br />And he came out, and went, as he was <b><font color="#9c1818">WONT</font></b>, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.  And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.  And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed. (<scripRef>Luke 22:39-41</scripRef>)

WORMWOOD
<i>A bitter plant; bitterness.</i><br /><br />For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: but her end is bitter as <b><font color="#9c1818">WORMWOOD</font></b>, sharp as a twoedged sword.  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. (<scripRef>Proverbs 5:3-5</scripRef>)

WOT
<i>To know.</i><br /><br />God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.  <b><font color="#9c1818">WOT</font></b> ye not what the scripture saith of Elias?   How he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. (<scripRef>Romans 11:2-3</scripRef>)

WREST
<i>To wrench; to torture by twisting.</i><br /><br />And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable <b><font color="#9c1818">WREST</font></b>, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. (<scripRef>2 Peter 3:15-16</scripRef>)

WROTH
<i>To be provoked; angered.</i><br /><br />Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding <b><font color="#9c1818">WROTH</font></b>, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. (<scripRef>Matthew 2:16</scripRef>)

WROUGHT
<i>Worked; made.</i><br /><br />For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but <b><font color="#9c1818">WROUGHT</font></b> with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you. (<scripRef>2 Thessalonians 3:7-8</scripRef>)

YEA
<i>Yes; certainly.</i><br /><br />But let your communication be, <b><font color="#9c1818">YEA</font></b>, <b><font color="#9c1818">YEA</font></b>; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. (<scripRef>Matthew 5:37</scripRef>)

YONDER
<i>There; in that place.</i><br /><br />Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to <b><font color="#9c1818">YONDER</font></b> place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. (<scripRef>Matthew 17:19-20</scripRef>)
